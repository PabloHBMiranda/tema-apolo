And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project some insight into the community that supports it. And get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have with me today, Sarah Norris. She is the Core Tech Editor in the WordPress 6.4 release. Welcome, Sarah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:47] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Oh, hi, and thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:50] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First, I should give everyone kind of a concept of what we&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is the WordPress 6.4 sneak peek episode of our podcast, which means that we&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about like the stuff that we are excited to get into the release stuff that we&#8217;re hoping is actually going to make it into the final release. But also, we&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about like stuff that we wish people knew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That we were working on. Things that are going to be really cool for users or developers or plugin authors, theme authors, things like that, that otherwise people would miss because it&#8217;s just hard to see. And so before we get started on all of that, is this your first release where you&#8217;re part of a squad like this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:31] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Ah, so, it&#8217;s actually my second. I was part of 6.1 as well. I led the default theme of 2023. But I am finding that the experience is a little bit different. So I&#8217;m still learning probably just as much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:42] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Well, and in 6.1 versus 6.4, for one, the themes are very different. Like the default themes are very different, but also the tasks involved with leading a default theme are very different from like leading things happening in the core editor in that Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:01] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s so many different tasks. Yeah, like, I guess maybe there&#8217;s such, there&#8217;s maybe just like a set of tasks for every part of the release squad. But they&#8217;re so different. And much more involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And as of the time of this recording, we&#8217;re recording this on September 27th. It comes out a little bit later. But as of the time of this recording, like we just wrapped up beta 1 for WordPress 6.4 yesterday. But I understand that, like an hour ago, you wrapped up a final release of the Gutenberg plugin as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re just kind of everywhere with us right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:36] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly right. Yeah, we tried to make the beta 1 for 6.4 and the latest release of Gutenberg quite close together to make it easier to, to merge those latest changes for beta 1 of 6.4. So yes, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so close together, and fingers crossed, they both went really smoothly, so I&#8217;m really happy about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:53] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now we all sit around and watch the support queues and hope. That part, the sitting around and watching the support queues, is both my most favorite and least favorite sometimes part of releases. Like, it&#8217;s a little bit my most favorite because I get to talk to our support folks. I&#8217;m like, hey, is anything happening? But also, it&#8217;s my least favorite because it&#8217;s like the Schrödinger&#8217;s cat of releases. You&#8217;re like, as long as I don&#8217;t look at it, it could be all well or all bad, and I just don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:23] <strong>Sarah:</strong> I hear you. I&#8217;ve just been doing something similar with watching test releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Just waiting and waiting and waiting. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s talk a little bit about 6.4. So WordPress 6.4 is our third major release of 2023, which is kind of a big deal for one because, like, three major releases a year is always exciting. But this particular one is, on the one hand, much larger from a feature standpoint than we kind of expected it to be, or so far, it looks like it&#8217;s going to be a bit larger than we expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it is our second iteration of an underrepresented gender release squad. Which I am very excited about. It&#8217;s a way for us to kind of bring in a lot of voices that otherwise we don&#8217;t see in the space. And so we&#8217;re going to just kind of talk through both of those things today. But let&#8217;s start with first: what are the things that are going into the release that you personally are most excited about, that you are most interested in making sure that we get all the way to the end of the release cycle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Sarah:</strong> So, ones that I am particularly excited for. So, the first one on my list is the Font Library. This is looking really good to include as well. So it&#8217;s gonna do your way for users to manage fonts across their site regardless of their active themes. So similar how to how their media library works at the moment for images and other media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:44] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And if I recall correctly when I was looking at the prototypes for that, like the early demos of it, that has a lot of local font management as well, which helps us with GDPR concerns that we have had with font management in the CMS for a while. One, is that still correct? And two, does it look like it&#8217;s going to make it into the release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yes. Yeah. Both correct. Yes. Yeah. Very easy. Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly right. So yeah, all the fonts will be managed locally. So, including things like Google Fonts. And any of the popular libraries and the way it&#8217;s been built, as it calls its files like this, it&#8217;s been built with extensibility in mind. So yeah, hopefully, the possibility should be endless for any number of font collections to be added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. I, I know, for folks who are listening to this later, hopefully not much later, but if you are listening to this between when beta 1 came out and between and beta 2 is coming out, we didn&#8217;t get as much of that into beta 1 as we expected, but beta 2 should have a good chunk of it in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So get out there and test that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:43] <strong>Sarah:</strong> It&#8217;s also just been released with Gutenberg 16.7 as well. So, I guess for anyone that you just mentioned listening in between.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:51] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m one of those folks that has not; I don&#8217;t run trunk because I&#8217;m not that good with like preventing WordPress from falling apart. I&#8217;m not a developer, but I do run the nightlies and for the major releases for Core, and I run also the beta of Gutenberg. And so, I got both updates done this morning and started going in and looking at everything because I don&#8217;t run trunk. I didn&#8217;t have some of the weird edge cases that I saw reported over the last few weeks, which is probably good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But also, if anyone&#8217;s running trunk and is running all of the nightlies of anything, let us know where the problems are because there are not a lot of you. It feels like, like, a thousand people in the particular combination. What else is in there that you are very excited to see?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:37] <strong>Sarah:</strong> I&#8217;m also looking forward to, so we have a new feature called Block Hook, and for anyone who follows Gutenberg, you might have heard it&#8217;s called Auto Inserting Blocks, but we&#8217;ve renamed it to Block Hook. And yes, this is another powerful feature that expands the extensibility of block themes. And so it allows plugins to automatically insert blocks into content relative to another block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, a good example that we&#8217;ve been using is automatically adding a like button to the post content block. And so yeah, I think it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s maybe a more developer-centric feature.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, like, it detects what block you have and suggests bits and pieces that otherwise would make sense there that other people are usually using in those blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:20] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. So you can add all through JSON as well. You can add a block that will automatically be added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:25] <strong>Josepha:</strong> All right. Excellent. That was part of the Interactivity API, or is, is early parts of it rather, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:35] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yes, that&#8217;s right. Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Another thing that is a part of the Interactivity API, which we&#8217;ve been working on, folks. I think everybody knows for like a year or two. The other part that is shipping in 6.4 is, I think, the Lightbox for images. Is that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:55] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yes, that&#8217;s right. Yes. And yeah, that&#8217;s due to be included with 6.4 as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m going to just tell us all a weird story. So, for maybe my entire life, like I understand what a lightbox is from a image and photography standpoint, but for the majority of my life, I thought that lightbox referred to those like big initial letters in old manuscripts. I don&#8217;t actually know what those are called if not lightboxes, but in my mind, that&#8217;s what they were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:22] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so when we first started talking about this, I was like, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re shipping is like the drop capital letter, like the big one, but it&#8217;s not. In case anyone else also was confused about what a lightbox is, it&#8217;s the image-based concept of a lightbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:37] <strong>Sarah:</strong> I think it&#8217;s an important one because previously you would have to install, maybe a third-party plugin or, or build lightbox yourself so. It may sound like a, oh, it&#8217;s a tiny feature that&#8217;s been included, but it&#8217;s actually pretty awesome. You don&#8217;t have to include even more extra code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:51] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Speaking of things that we have been working on for two years or so, I think that every sneak peek for the last year, the folks of WordPress have heard me say that I was super excited about navigation and how we&#8217;re managing it, but it turns out that is a very complicated thing. Like we know that, managing menus, managing navigation on a site is complicated from just like a philosophical standpoint. When our users of WordPress, when consumers of WordPress like go through that process, that is the hardest one to explain. And therefore, very hard to manage as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have had like a requirement that you know three different admins in order to manage your menu, manage your navigation on your site, but we shipped some early components for it in 6.3 and in 6.4. I believe that we are planning; I&#8217;m crossing my fingers no one can see it, crossing my fingers. We&#8217;re planning on getting an updated treatment for the toolbar out. Is that correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:53] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yes, yeah, I was a little bit worried because I didn&#8217;t know too much in detail, but I did know about the toolbar. So, yes, yes, I believe that is planned to get into 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So, and the point of that, because for folks who have not tried this out yet, the point of that is that the navigation is kind of, when you look at it, individual components, it&#8217;s like a bunch of little blocks together, and then we wrap it as like a collection that shows up as the navigation block, but because it&#8217;s a bunch of little blocks and each of the little blocks has their own like toolbar that goes with it, it took a lot of work to kind of figure out how to get all of those toolbars to have a primary expression with the navigation. Versus like every single thing that you put into your navigation has its own toolbar, and good luck to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:44] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a really, really complicated problem, and I guess maybe it always has been, and hopefully we just keep improving and all the time, and we probably never will stop improving because it&#8217;s, yeah, it&#8217;s just such a complicated thing to edit, and I think particularly in an editor without using any code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:01] <strong>Sarah:</strong> We&#8217;re getting there, it always, it always is getting better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Before we move into the question of like things that you wish people knew about the release that maybe they&#8217;re not going to know, I do want to stop and talk about the default theme a little bit. Everyone loves the default theme at the end of the year. But every year, Matt and I talk about, like, what would it look like if we didn&#8217;t have a default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we just were like, all themes are great. Just do whatever you want, which seems too difficult, frankly. But the way that this default theme is envisioned is so different. It&#8217;s got basically three different focuses. Do you know much about this year&#8217;s default theme?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:41] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, a little bit, so I, yeah, I know, I don&#8217;t know, I think it&#8217;s shaping up to be a really good starting point for so many different types of projects. So, I know that that is maybe the aim of every default theme. But we usually show off a lot of the features that are going into the release, like via the default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know we did that last time as well, but this time, we&#8217;re doing that stealth. But we&#8217;re also creating like a great baseline for so many different types of projects. And I think maybe in the past, we&#8217;ve maybe only hit like one type of project. And, like, this is a good example for this one very specific thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, this time, I know that that&#8217;s always like, especially working with other themers, they&#8217;re like, what&#8217;s the best base theme for this type of thing? And I&#8217;m hoping Twenty Twenty-Four is going to be the new answer for so many people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I looked at the early designs for that with the, because what it has, and these, we&#8217;ll put a link to this in the show notes to the repo about it and the Figma file and all those things. But what it has is like a really robust set of default patterns for anyone who&#8217;s wanting to have like a big commercial site with a lot of things that are required, a really complicated site. Then we have a suite of default patterns that are shipping so that artists and people who are focused primarily on visual assets on their site have the specific patterns and blocks and things required for that and then one that is specific to people who focus on the content in their site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am one of the people who specifically focuses on the content in the site. I was delighted to see that, but it kind of has three different levels of varying complexity based on what it is that people might, might want to have to, oh, not want to have to, might want to be able to do on their sites. And I think that&#8217;s kind of cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:31] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s super cool. And I think while we&#8217;re still in the development cycle as well, for 6.4, this is a; the default theme is a great way to jump into contributing if people are looking for good ways to jump in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:44] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, it runs in a separate repo. And so it has a little bit of a different process, but also it feels like a little bit of a faster process. It kind of runs independently of the release cycle that we have for either the plugin or core. And so it kind of goes a bit faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Excellent. So, then, obvious next question. What Is happening in this release that you wish people knew about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:15] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yep. Okay. So, I think maybe things that are difficult to fit into the bigger categories that will be easy to shout about when we talk about the release when it&#8217;s been released. There&#8217;s a lot of accessibility enhancement that are going to be included. So there&#8217;s things like better button placements and upgraded spoken messages, especially in site health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also so many performance improvements that are scheduled to be included, so I know there was many performance improvements included in 6.3. We are continuing that for 6.4. There&#8217;s many more improvements to block themes and classic themes in the way the templates are loaded. And we&#8217;ve also got a we&#8217;re including a usage of the new defer and async loading strategies as well for script.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these are sort of like, nitty-gritty detail sort of things that will be included that don&#8217;t sound too exciting but are actually really, really cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I understand the whole like, this is not very exciting. This doesn&#8217;t sound interesting but trust me, it is like, sometimes it feels like half of my job is that I&#8217;m like, I know that nothing I&#8217;m about to say sounds cool, but trust me, it&#8217;s amazing. We&#8217;ve been working on it for a long time, and it&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s great. And so. For those things, it sounds like a lot, this is going to particularly be of interest to folks who are developing for other people using WordPress. But also obviously a little bit of, of benefit, maybe invisible benefit, but still benefit for our end users as we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:46] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s right, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:48] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So those are kind of the sneak peek items that we&#8217;ve got going into the release. As always, with this particular episode, we&#8217;re not promising that any of those things will 100 percent for sure get in there. There is part of being a release squad that kind of doesn&#8217;t really get talked about outside of WordPress but is probably worth mentioning, which is that the release squad has the really unpleasant job of saying no at the last second for things that are breaking something, things that are not actually a better user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we have the uncomfortable job of saying like, no, it wasn&#8217;t good enough. Sorry, thank you. Come again in the next release cycle. And so, like, all of these things are things that are currently in and being tested, but in the event that we discover it breaks 10 percent of the sites that we have on WordPress, like, we&#8217;re gonna, we&#8217;re gonna pull it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, right now, that&#8217;s all in there, we hope, and if listening to me for a whole year get excited about the changes in navigation, and then also not getting them in didn&#8217;t teach you anything, just because I want it in doesn&#8217;t mean that I get to have it in either. So, but yeah, so that&#8217;s exciting. The other exciting thing about this release, we mentioned it a bit at the top of the discussion, is that it is a gender-upresented, gender-underrepresented release squad. Not upresented, because that is a, not a word. And so this is the second one. Did you participate in the first one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:22] <strong>Sarah:</strong> No, I didn&#8217;t no. Yeah, but I have read all about it, especially in prep to this release as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, did you learn anything from it that you brought into this one, or was it just like, I need to know what I&#8217;m getting into kind of reading a lot about it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:36] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, basically, yeah, I was trying to prep myself, ever since I was involved in 6.1, I&#8217;ve tried to be, I&#8217;ve tried to follow along closely with the releases. But sometimes, there&#8217;s just so much going on all the time. Sometimes it&#8217;s a little bit much. But yeah, I just wanted to see if there was any, any big differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There shouldn&#8217;t be, right? So yeah, it&#8217;s all good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think all of the differences were in that boring part where people don&#8217;t, they&#8217;re like, that sounds so un-fun, we&#8217;re going to just stop listening. But it was like, in the planning and preparation for it, and the way that we did all the training, like the initial one had like an 18 month period between like, we&#8217;re gonna do it, and now it&#8217;s done, where we did a lot of additional work to get everybody in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And this time, we were like, get in here! That&#8217;s all we did. So, how has your experience been on the release squad? I know that you did one before. You did one in 6.1, but is this particular squad any different compared to your last experience of it, or what you expected?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:35] <strong>Sarah:</strong> So, I would say everyone is equally as amazing as every release and, including the resource they&#8217;re involved with. I think that the biggest difference for me, and maybe this links to something you just said, is that I, I knew I was going to be involved in the release squad a lot earlier, especially compared to me for 6.1, but I think I&#8217;ve heard other people say that as well. So, I think that&#8217;s a great thing for this release. We all have had some time ahead of the release and including during this 6.3 release as well, so I was able to watch particular people in, not in a non-creepy way, and make sure I knew which, like what the processes were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, to try and get my head around when when I&#8217;d be doing it. And, and obviously, the big help was that I&#8217;d be doing it immediately after they&#8217;d just done it as well. And the previous release squad has been a massive help as well when I&#8217;ve come across either very, very complicated issues or like super silly issues; I can write them and answer your questions so that I think if we could carry that forward with the future releases as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. So this time around, we had almost 50 percent new folks that that, like, let us know that they were participating, probably quite a few more than that. But, like, of the people who let us know that they wanted to participate in this release, we had like 28 out of 50 people, something like that, who are brand new to contributing to WordPress in some cases, but certainly, all of them are brand new to contributing to a major release like this. Have you, cause this is not your first time doing this, but it is your first time in this type of release. Have you found that, like, you&#8217;re feeling able to help new people see what&#8217;s happening also, like, do you feel seasoned enough for that? Or are you just like, nope, I&#8217;m also new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:17] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Maybe a little bit of both. I guess I, yeah, I&#8217;m fortunate to have at least experienced, maybe, like how the deadlines roll. Actually, especially the point we&#8217;re at at the moment, where the weekly beta cycles happened. Last time, it took me by surprise. I was like, oh wow, okay, we have a week. Until the next one, and then a week, and so yeah, I feel a bit more psyched up for that this time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hopefully, I can tap that on you to the new folks as well. But yeah, I also noticed we have a lot of new people. We have, especially from a core editor tech lead; I think we have nearly 30 people who are sort of officially following us along or shadowing us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, yeah, but it&#8217;s really cool. I hope we can teach so many more people if they want to get involved with the next release or even just contributing in general. Yeah, it&#8217;d be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. If you are listening to our podcast, and you think to yourself, well, I&#8217;m here. And I wonder if anyone knows because I&#8217;m just watching everyone in a non-creepy way, like feel free at the next meeting that you&#8217;re watching to, to raise your hand and say, I&#8217;m new. We want to know that you&#8217;re there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not because we feel creepy otherwise. But also because we just want to celebrate that you exist new folks that are scared of us. Don&#8217;t be scared of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, man, I feel compelled now to tell everybody about the first time that I led a core chat. So the core chat, I watched that without telling anyone I was watching it for like a year before I had to actually lead it, and I just didn&#8217;t tell anybody I was there like I didn&#8217;t even participate in the waving part at the start where it&#8217;s just like, Hey, everyone, I exist, like, when I was just silently watching it all go by and so when I got announced as part of a release squad. It was shocking for everyone, I think. And there is a public record of a moment where I was panicking. I felt like everyone was asking me a thousand questions, and I didn&#8217;t know the answers to any of them. And I just told all of them, like, there are a million of you and one of me, and you&#8217;re kind of scaring me, so would you stop?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a public record of me calling out every developer that existed in WordPress at the time. I felt bad about it in the moment, but also like, whew, that was, I don&#8217;t think we have experiences like that for new contributors anymore, but it was, it was quite a moment. I remember distinctly, so Jeffrey Paul, he&#8217;s like one of our, I think we have three or four like self-declared project managing people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is a project manager person in WordPress that I really rely on, and I was DM&#8217;ing him in the background in a full panic. I was like, I don&#8217;t know the answer to any of these questions. What am I supposed to do? And he was like no is also an answer. So, like, just tell them no. Tell them you don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s fine. And I was like, Oh, God! So, I think that we maybe don&#8217;t have too much of that happening anymore, but I also understand that I wouldn&#8217;t see it if it were happening. No one&#8217;s coming to me to be like, is this normal? Should I panic? They&#8217;re probably coming to you with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:21] <strong>Sarah:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a sort of good, I&#8217;m not good for you, maybe, but good for observers especially. You know, to see you go through that as well. I can really relate to, like, not even showing, like, a wave emoji because I&#8217;ve totally been in that situation. I think maybe we&#8217;re similar in that regard, like, it, sometimes I just feel really nervous even just showing an emoji.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think, again, shouting out about that and to, to those people who also feel like that, who are watching yeah, yeah, wave if you, if you feel like you want to, and don&#8217;t wave, it&#8217;s also fine just to watch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:48] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Once you&#8217;ve been to 52 meetings, then you can wave. Oh, it&#8217;s so hardworking in open source that way because, like, there is a lot of, like, basically faith in other people because trust comes with, like experiencing things together. But initially, you do just kind of have to have faith that no one&#8217;s going to laugh you out of the room or say that your ideas are stupid or that you are like even remotely understanding the problem, and so that&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a part of the new contributor experience that I always find so interesting I used to routinely give presentations about like this is how you get started first get ready to be uncomfortable I don&#8217;t give those presentations very often anymore but probably probably I should ask someone to get out there and be like, It&#8217;s scary for everyone, including you!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come be scared together! Cause I think that&#8217;s important to normalize. Fear&#8217;s normal. When you first started contributing to WordPress in general, let alone like being on a release squad, what is the team that you first joined through?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:02] <strong>Sarah:</strong> So, I guess, full-time contribution, it was themes. I was very involved with themes, and I still am as well; I really love themes, especially block themes. And also with the editor. But, like, years and years ago, I guess it was still themes. I used to build themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that was very much; I was a forum user, and well, actually, I guess it goes back to me being very nervous and not wanting to admit the question that I wanted to ask, so I would hunt the forums, but afterwards just so helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, yeah, I know this is a lot of people&#8217;s story, but yeah, the forums and just chatting amongst other community members is so, so helpful. So yeah, when I became a full-time contributor, I really, I love talking to other people who are trying to get help or, yeah, reaching out any way they can because I was like, I feel that I was you and still am you as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I mean, the good thing about it, like, we will always feel like we&#8217;re learning something because we are, but in my experience of folks in WordPress, and I haven&#8217;t been new in a long time, obviously been doing this for like eight years now which is ancient by technology standards, but like my favorite thing about folks in WordPress is that they are wanting to like learn enough to probably not break it forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like it&#8217;s the probably is in there, and the forever is in there like I want to. I want to know just enough to be mildly dangerous and then bring everybody with me. Let&#8217;s go be dangerous together. And I think that is really charming in a way because it&#8217;s like we know enough to sort of break it. But not break it a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s go see how we break it a little bit to make it better. I think that&#8217;s such a charming attitude for some reason because then we all just get to kind of learn and be a little bit messy together, which is the nature of openly collaborating on a half-written software—all the time. But yeah, I think it&#8217;s kind of neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:05] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, yeah, exactly. It&#8217;s exciting too, like if you&#8217;re staying, you&#8217;ve got that enough red push and edge that you&#8217;re just like, Ooh, I might break something. But then there&#8217;s so many people that help you out that, you know, just before you could actually break something important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. The one time when I did a very breaking thing because I didn&#8217;t know to ask about it and fixed it immediately was that I mentioned in the middle of a core chat that we were about to have a security release. But it wasn&#8217;t about it wasn&#8217;t like in the next 15 minutes, it was like three weeks away, which is not what you&#8217;re allowed to do like you are not allowed to mention that you have a security release coming in three weeks, and then hope that nobody figures out what it&#8217;s patching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I got so many messages in such a short amount of time from it felt like every lead developer of WordPress. That was my, my worst moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I fixed it immediately. So that was good. But also, I don&#8217;t remember if we had to like move up the, the timeline for that release or what. I don&#8217;t; I have no idea what the outcome was because I was just in an outright panic about what I had done incorrectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, so that&#8217;s the; I&#8217;m just going to tell everybody my most embarrassing early contribution stories today. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing. Excellent. Well, Sarah, before we head out of here, is there a final thought that you would like to share with either our listeners here or future potential contributors to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:37] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Please help test 6.4, especially through the next few cycles of beta. It would be amazing to have everyone and anyone who would like to help. That is one of the best ways you can help is to test. And then, yeah, if you want to get involved a little bit further, then yeah, I guess, please reach out wherever you think you fit, which I know sounds a bit fake, but there are a lot of different places, and I&#8217;m sure there will be somewhere you fit as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>00:28:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I will leave in the show notes a link to the page that has all of the upcoming meetings on it. You can probably go to almost any meeting and say, I think this is where I would like to contribute, but also, this is the kind of thing I can contribute, and they will be able to head you in the right direction if you&#8217;re not already in the right direction. But also, like, sometimes your skills that you have are going to be applicable in places where you&#8217;re not aware of yet. And so, go to any meeting—wave to the friendly WordPressers that are around, the Sarah Norrises that exist in the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:36] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sarah, thank you so much for joining me today. This was a delight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:39] <strong>Sarah:</strong> Thanks so much for having me on; I really enjoyed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:42] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:42] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things. First thing to know is that tomorrow we have Beta 2 for WordPress 6.4. This is our final release of the year, as you know because we&#8217;ve been talking about it for the entire episode. But, just like Sarah said at the end of our conversation, we absolutely need people to help us test it, make sure that it is working in as many places as possible so that we can have the best release possible. So keep an eye out on the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack, and of course, keep an eye on WordPress.org/news as those releases get packaged and ready to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second thing is a proposal for documentation translation localization process update. This is an initial step to consolidate all of that documentation into a single easy-to-reach location. So we need some feedback on it. Head on over there, leave a comment to share your feedback about where that should possibly go, where is most useful and valuable for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second proposal that I have is actually sort of a tangentially related one, but so it&#8217;s not specific to WordPress but does need some WordPress input. There is a call for proposal for Interop 2024. There&#8217;s a post that has a lot more information about it than I do, but we would like for any WordPress developer who&#8217;s interested to head over there and submit a proposal for what they could speak about at Interop, I believe. You can leave your thoughts on the post itself as a comment, or there&#8217;s also a GitHub repo where you can interact as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing on our small list of big things is that the WordCamp US Q&amp;A, the questions that we didn&#8217;t get to because there were something like 87 or something in the queue. The questions that we didn&#8217;t get to, the answers have been posted. They&#8217;re over on make.WordPress.org/project, but I&#8217;ll include a link to those to that post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on the small list of big things, I&#8217;m actually quite excited about. We are hosting now accessibility office hours. In an effort to improve accessibility knowledge in the WordPress project in general, the accessibility team will be holding office hours every Wednesday at 14:00 UTC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That started on September 20th. And so it&#8217;s been going for a couple of weeks now.

All while the foundational work continues for Phase 3 of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">WordPress roadmap</a>. Read on for some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Twenty Twenty-Four theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a> is a new default theme that will launch with 6.4. With a versatile collection of templates and patterns, this theme covers a diverse range of use cases, from entrepreneurs to small businesses to artists and writers. Twenty Twenty-Four also emphasizes the latest design tooling and site editing features, enabling you to leverage the flexibility of blocks and unlock numerous creative possibilities with just a few tweaks. Follow the theme&#8217;s progress and report any issues on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentyfour\">this GitHub repo</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Manage fonts across your site</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.4 will introduce new font management features:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59166\">Font Library</a> enables you to handle fonts across your site, regardless of your active theme—just like you manage assets in the Media Library. Easily install local and Google Fonts and choose which to activate for each theme. This new font manager is a powerful way to control a fundamental piece of your site&#8217;s design and branding without coding. Thanks to its <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53307\">extensibility</a>, custom typographic collections can expand your font choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59165\">Font Face</a> provides server-side <code>@font-face</code> style generation and printing support. It introduces a new global function called <code>wp_print_font_faces()</code>, which processes font data received from styles set in the editor or by the active theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update (October 5, 2023): </strong>The Font Library feature will not debut in WordPress 6.4. Instead, it has been postponed to the next major release, 6.5. WordPress is committed to delivering the best possible experience, meaning this feature requires more feedback and testing to shine. Thank you for your understanding!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add lightbox functionality to your images</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Showcase your images in an interactive fashion with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51132\">lightbox functionality</a>. This new core feature will be available for Image blocks, allowing visual assets to be opened and enlarged on top of the existing content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enjoy new writing improvements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53305\">Many enhancements</a> in 6.4 will ensure that your WordPress writing experience remains smooth and enjoyable, from new keyboard shortcuts to more reliable pasting from other sources. Moreover, a fresh toolbar experience will be available for the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53697\">Navigation</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53306\">List</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53699\">Quote</a> blocks, making working with their tooling options more efficient and intuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More design tools, greater creativity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New design tools will improve the overall creation experience with WordPress while providing greater layout control and flexibility. Some updates include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53934\">Background images for Group blocks</a>, allowing for creative and customized layouts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54216\">Aspect ratios for image placeholders</a>—a new feature that’s particularly useful when creating and using patterns. After setting a placeholder’s desired aspect ratio, you can drag and drop an image, which will adjust to maintain the design consistency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53667\">Button and heading color customization in Group</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54104\">Columns blocks</a>, enabling you to define the appearance of these elements when placed within these container blocks. This feature takes a step towards allowing <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40318\">section-specific styling</a>, which will continue to develop in upcoming releases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54416\">Alignment settings in synced patterns</a>. When creating and converting a synced pattern with wide, full-width, left or right-aligned blocks, this improvement ensures alignment attributes remain intact for a seamless site editing and pattern creation experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Upgrades for smoother workflows</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Site Editor continues to evolve and expand its capabilities, so do the interface and tools that support it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First introduced in WordPress 6.3, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-command-palette/\">Command Palette</a> helps you perform actions, search, and quickly navigate your site&#8217;s content and settings. It will receive significant updates in 6.4, featuring an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53117\">updated design</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52509#top\">new commands</a> to accomplish block-specific actions, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53496\">better command language and action consistency</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/list-view/\">List View</a> provides a great way to browse and work with the blocks that make up your site. This release will introduce enhancements to its interface and usability, making it even more powerful. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53735\">rename Group blocks</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53381\">view media previews for Gallery and Image blocks</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53559\">duplicate blocks with a keyboard shortcut</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pattern advancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-patterns/\">Patterns</a><strong> </strong>play an essential role in site editing, and its importance remains prominent in the upcoming release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.4 will allow you to better organize <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53835\">your synced and unsynced patterns with categories</a> as part of the creation process. These categories are available for sorting within the insertion flow to make discovering and adding patterns easier. In addition, you can conveniently access all your custom patterns from the same place—the Patterns section of the Block Inserter, which removes the separate tab for synced patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other improvements include <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54337\">importing and exporting patterns as JSON files</a>, ensuring backward compatibility with Reusable blocks, and enabling pattern transfer across sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, building on the groundwork laid in WordPress 6.3, this release will improve the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/52150\">pattern management experience for non-block themes</a> by adding a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58827\">Patterns tab</a> under the Appearance menu, allowing access to the Pattern list page of the admin screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Update (October 2, 2023): </em></strong><em>While 6.4 will bring several exciting pattern advancements, the previously mentioned improved pattern management experience for non-block themes will regrettably not be included in the 6.4 release. Thank you for your understanding, and be on the lookout for it in WordPress 6.5.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing Block Hooks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59313\">Block Hooks</a> is a new powerful feature that enriches the extensibility of block themes, drawing inspiration from the familiar WordPress <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/wordpress-filter-hooks/\">Hooks</a> concept. Upon activation, plugins can automatically insert blocks into content relative to another block. For example, a &#8220;Like&#8221; button block can automatically be inserted after the Post Content block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While developer-centric, Block Hooks enhances the user experience by making block usage more intuitive and allowing for further customization and control over where and how the auto-inserted blocks appear. A <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52969\">new block inspector panel</a> named &#8220;Plugins&#8221; is designed to respect creators&#8217; preferences, ensuring you can add, dismiss, or relocate Block Hooks as desired.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.4 has 70 accessibility improvements slated for inclusion, 60 of those are included in Beta 1. Notable updates focused on enhancing the user interface (UI) experience include <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40822\">better button placements</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47125\">improved context for “Add New” admin menu items</a>, and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58573\">upgraded spoken messages in Site Health</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, fixes for <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58756\">image editing in the Media Library</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30685\">error reporting on the login screen</a>, and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58756\">&#8220;no motion&#8221; settings for GIFs</a> have been implemented. The cause of some <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58703\">false positives in automated UI tests</a> has been corrected, and users without JavaScript now see a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59229\">direct link to install the Classic Editor plugin</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it. And get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> In our last episode, we talked about the Community Summit and some trends that I was seeing. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time since then summarizing the notes from each session, and I was processing notes from the session about aligning WordPress Enterprise and WordPress Community, which is a session that explored the various strengths and weaknesses of WordPress from an enterprise perspective, but especially when it comes to contributing to or communicating about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, my vantage point on analyses like these is generally pretty different. Since I work mainly in an operations space for the project, I&#8217;m almost always looking at the health and safety of our ecosystem, product excellence, funding, things like that. So, I especially like to attend sessions that are from the vantage point of people who are much closer to the work than I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> When I looked at the brainstormed list of things from the session, my first inclination was to catalog the relationships between what we saw as a positive or a negative and the things that we saw as intrinsic to us versus part of the environment. But the more I look at it, the more I see that there&#8217;s confirmation of what I have always known to be true. That WordPress is a valuable starting point for web-based solutions of all sizes and any purpose. Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the biggest themes that shine through from that session. I was able to distill them down to about nine primary themes, but I especially want to focus on some that come up year after year in talking with our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:57] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The first, of course, is the community and ecosystem. If you&#8217;ve listened to this podcast 62 times, then you&#8217;ve heard me say at least like 60 times that the community is what sets us apart from other open source projects. But, I would encourage you to expand that understanding to include the ecosystem that the community provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community not only helps to plan and create WordPress, our primary software, but it also makes it distributable through the Polyglots team and Accessibility and Docs and Training. It also makes it extendable through plugins and themes and all of the work that goes into reviewing plugins and themes and the support that&#8217;s provided to people who come to the WordPress.org site, trying to figure out how to make this thing work for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we also, this community, make it knowable, not only through the community part with our event series but also in marketing and the videos that we provide on WordPress TV and all of the training and learning cohorts that we provide on learn.WordPress.org, all of those teams make WordPress learnable and knowable and easy to use and usable to more people and available across the world, regardless of whether you speak English or not. And so yeah, the community and the ecosystem are some of the things that makes WordPress valuable for enterprise, but also WordPress valuable in general.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second is the software&#8217;s usability and flexibility. I said at WordCamp US that we exist for as long as people want to use our software, and that&#8217;s a funny little two-sided coin for us. WordPress remains very usable for folks who come to it in the same way that I came to it, which is as a user who is trying to accomplish a goal unrelated to WordPress. I didn&#8217;t start using WordPress because I wanted to figure out how WordPress worked or because I wanted to figure out how to contribute to WordPress. I came to WordPress because I was trying to market something, and WordPress was the best choice for that. But it&#8217;s also flexible for our brilliant developers out there who are doing things like building a suite of sites for NASA or creating bespoke social networks. So, our usability and flexibility, both of those things working together, are certainly one of the things that make me know that WordPress is incredibly valuable for anyone who needs to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:22] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But the final thing is WordPress&#8217;s longevity or our resilience. So, I used to work at a marketing agency that served enterprise-level clients. And any time we pitched a new site build to a client, one of the main elements of discussion during decision-making was how long the decision would last. Do you want a page that you can launch in a day, run a six-week campaign through, and then abandon it forever? Or do you want a site that can take up to six weeks to build but can be yours to refine and hone for years after that? I know this seems like a silly example, but when you&#8217;re looking at the potential for a long-term bet, what you&#8217;re worried about, what you&#8217;re asking is, is this a software trusted in my industry? Is it time-tested by those companies I aspire to be? Is the available workforce composed of seasoned professionals or flash-in-the-pan peddlers of the latest craze? And of that workforce, how many will still be doing this in five years? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question of how long we&#8217;ve been doing this and why it matters that WordPress has been here for 20 years and has no intention of going anywhere should be so much higher on everyone&#8217;s list of reasons to use this software. Yes, the WordPress software is powerful enough to be everything you might want it to be someday, but the WordPress ecosystem brought to us by this community has shown resilience through major breaking changes in 2008, 2016, 2018, 2020, and probably a lot of things between there that we have forgotten. So, if I were hoping to hedge my bets on a long-term solution, I would absolutely place those bets on this community, this ecosystem, and this software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And now, it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things. I actually have a very big list today, so I&#8217;m just gonna break it out into two chunks. The first chunk is that we actually have a lot of calls for feedback and testing right now. We have six calls for feedback and testing that I really could use your input on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one is that we still are having that discussion about how to evolve the FSE outreach program. That program started as a way to get faster, more fluid user feedback, specifically about full site editing inside Gutenberg. But there is a question now about where it needs to exist, how it&#8217;s serving current project needs, and what the future project needs will be. And so stop by that one. That should be a good, lively discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Speaking of discussions that are lively, we also have an update to the field guide. We have a proposed update to the field guide. This is not something that we&#8217;re looking to put in place for WordPress 6.4, just because that is coming so quickly. But it is something that we want to look at for future iterations of the field guide that come out with every major release. We want to make sure that we&#8217;re getting valuable information to the right people at the right time without having so much that it&#8217;s overwhelming but also without having so little that we miss really important things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:47] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There is another request for feedback, which is about additional ideas on the future of WordPress events. I brought this up in the past. I think I mentioned it on one other small list of big things, but there&#8217;s still time. So, if you&#8217;ve been shy about sharing your ideas, let this be your sign to get brave. Go share your thoughts on what events of the future should be for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There&#8217;s also a proposal for updated support guidelines. This proposal comes out of a discussion that was had at WordCamp US, and so there is a summary of the discussion and then also the proposal that&#8217;s out there. I think that for all guidelines like this, support guidelines, and probably all things that require some review from ourselves, we always could stand to take a look at where those are, what brought us to where we are today, and what we can use to be better and more current in our client&#8217;s needs and our customers needs users needs as we are looking through those guidelines I think that the deadline for feedback on that is around the middle of September as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:47] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final bit of feedback/call for testing is on performant translations. That is a testing call for feedback. Contributions to that can be made on GitHub as well if that&#8217;s something where you test it and you immediately know how to offer some patches to make things better. That&#8217;s great, but you can always just leave your feedback in a comment or a new support topic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:19] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Okay, so that was the first chunk of the small list of big things. We have the second chunk of the small list of big things, which is to say that if all of that was new to you and sounds a little bit daunting and, you need some support to get started. There are also a couple of kind of group things that you can do in the coming weeks to get you started on that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a new WordPress diversity training session that&#8217;s happening. It&#8217;s a two-day workshop for women, specifically in India, but other countries are welcome to join us, too. We&#8217;ll be thinking about how to pull together your first presentation proposal, I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next one is that the WordPress community team is looking for folks to learn more about organizing meetups. And so, I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes as well, but if you&#8217;ve never done this before and that did not sound like a getting started thing, trust me, organizing meetups not only is something that is easy to do because it&#8217;s kind of casual, you can get people together like in a coffee shop to talk about WordPress, but also the team over there has excellent onboarding. And so give it a try; at the very least, give it a read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing on that set of things is that there&#8217;s a new group called WP Includes working to pair women in the WordPress community with one another for support and advice along their career paths. I will include a link to that in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is that there is a meetup event that&#8217;s focused on flagship events coming up on September 21st. It will recap WordCamp US and host an open discussion for ideas for WordCamp Europe as well. Like I said, that&#8217;s going to take place on September 21st. I will include a link to that in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you don&#8217;t know where the show notes are, if you, sorry, if you&#8217;re listening to this on, like, Pocketcasts or Spotify or any other thingy, and you don&#8217;t know what I mean when I say the show notes, and you&#8217;ve literally never seen them in your life. You can go to WordPress.org/news/podcast, and there are transcripts and show notes with every podcast I put up, and that&#8217;s what I mean when I say that. WordPress.org/news/podcast, and then you get a bunch of links. It&#8217;ll be great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Outro music)</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"15971\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Openverse Wins the 2023 OEG Open Infrastructure Award\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/09/openverse-wins-the-2023-oeg-open-infrastructure-award/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Sep 2023 18:04:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Awards\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"award\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15967\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:403:\"WordPress is excited to announce that Openverse has been awarded the 2023 Open Education Award for Excellence in the Open Infrastructure category!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;We are back and catching up from our midyear break. And in true WordPress fashion, we&#8217;re just going to start off running. The WordPress Community Summit happened a couple of weeks ago. I&#8217;ve been talking about it on this podcast for a few months now, but if you&#8217;ve missed it and you want a refresher, go ahead and give episode 49 a listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Community Summit, there were 125 people, if I remember correctly. And we covered a wide array of topics that were brought to us directly from the community itself. While the event is small, it is specifically designed for gathering and sharing information. So, I&#8217;ve got some top-level trends that I noticed that I&#8217;m going to share with you all today, as well as just like a reminder of what happens after a Community Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;So there are three, maybe four, big trends that I noticed. The first one that I noticed is that we have a lot of discussions right now about contributor acknowledgment. That also, for what it&#8217;s worth, came with an unresolved question around whether acknowledgment and recognition are the same. I don&#8217;t think they are the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also was part of a conversation around whether we treat those two things the same. And if they are not the same, should we treat them differently? And et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. For folks who&#8217;ve been around for a bit, you know, that we spent a lot of time working on our contributor recognition a few years back and had really made quite a bit of difference in just reported feelings about how the community felt they were being recognized for their contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so a lot of the conversations that we ended up having were around whether or not the project as a whole has changed the way that we provide that recognition or acknowledgment. Or, as an alternative, if the community that is supporting WordPress has changed how they would like to be recognized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;There were also some questions about whether or not making sure that contributors can see their impact. Like they can say, I contributed 10 hours last month, and these are the two things that I got accomplished over there, and that everyone else can see those things too. So, how we can do that more easily while also not having so many metrics and making the metrics so prevalent that we start to close out the people who are truly just doing this for fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of the problems that we have at the Community Summit, this is a bunch of pretty much unsolved mysteries at the moment. But it did; it came up across probably five or six different sessions that I heard about, quite a few that I went to myself, and so contributor acknowledgment and recognition is on our minds again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second thing that I noticed across multiple sessions, and this one honestly is not a surprise at all, is that there were a lot of questions about what the next big thing is after Gutenberg. I always love when people are asking big questions about what comes next because it means that we all still believe that there will be a next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And so I never hesitate when I hear these questions to give some ideas about what I think might be coming. But a lot of the discussions that we were having were around, we think this is coming, but now that we think this is coming, what should we do now to make sure that we are ready for it? One of the biggest assumptions that we all had is that for the CMS, for the software itself, probably our next big area after Gutenberg is going to be something about artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt pointed out in his presentation that he has told us twice to learn something deeply. One was in 2016 when he said, learn JavaScript Deeply. And then one was in 2022 when he said to learn AI deeply. And so we all kind of are guessing that that is our future area. And so that&#8217;s an area for everyone to spend some time in. Make sure you understand it. Make sure you know it a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that came up as like a future, where are we going here? It was kind of on the business-y side. It was on a lot of questions about enterprise and are we selling properly to enterprise. Can we sell, can we appeal to enterprise? Whose job is it to sell any of these things? Questions like that. So, lots of business questions again. This is not something that I have any concerns about. I&#8217;m very excited to see that people are talking about it. That&#8217;s been a topic of conversation since, I want to say, February of this year. And so it also wasn&#8217;t a surprise inclusion today. And, and I was excited to see, am excited to see what we get out of those conversations over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;As far as like questions around what&#8217;s next for the community, I&#8217;m going to address that separately because it was a huge question for everyone. So I&#8217;m going to discuss that as soon as we get finished with this chunk about like the big thing that, that is coming after Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, from an ecosystem perspective. Like a WordPress project operations perspective, this came up a couple of times. Never in as clear a word, a set of words as that, but the question about, like, what are we doing with our tools? Are we making sure that we are keeping the tools that our contributors use maintained and still in an excellent space with features that are useful and, necessary, and requested?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is a big question. I do have a lot of questions about that. Also, there are so many tools that I have wanted in order to make organizing the WordPress community better and easier, but also making contributing better and easier. And hopefully, here soon, we have an opportunity to get to some of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;So, the third big trend that I kept seeing at the Community Summit is actually about the community itself, specifically about events. So I was part of or listened to many, many, many conversations over the course of the week that were specifically focused on what we&#8217;re going to do with the future of our events. Like are meetups still sustainable? Are WordCamps still sustainable? And that&#8217;s from not only the idea of sustainability that we all tend to know from like an ecological standpoint but also, you know, checking in on the resources. So the kinds of questions that folks had were, is it time to continue having many small events, or is it time to move to a few giant events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should we bring back midsized, WP-adjacent events like PressNomics or LoopConf? And if we are bringing those back, do we want to have them be part of a semi-official thing along with a clearly WordPress event and like do joint sales in there? Try to figure out how to get people from one to the other, so that it&#8217;s not just WordPress people that we&#8217;re talking to, but also business people and advanced developers, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a lot of discussion about whether or not we have gotten too big, should we double down on our grassroots efforts? Just go all the way back to, like, BarCamp style, WordPress in a forest kind of thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And yeah, and among all of these conversations, there were questions about the resources that we need. Do we have what we need now? Do we have plans for how to maintain those resources in the future? Do we have enough time? Do we have enough money? Do we have an expertise? The people? So many questions, so many questions. And on the community side of things, we also had a lot of questions that are routine in open source. Like, do we have a pipeline for future maintainers, for future team reps, for future leaders in the project? All of the questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, those are the three slash four, depending on how you break it out, really big trends that I saw across the conversation at the Community Summit. And I don&#8217;t necessarily know the answers to all of these things. Like, I know what my gut tells me, I know what I believe the answer to be. From my own perspective, but as you&#8217;ve been told many times with many eyes, all bugs are shallow. And so here is what happens next with a Community Summit. So we&#8217;ve gathered all of these things together. We&#8217;ve had these conversations, and now all of the notes from every conversation that we had will be put on make.wordpress.org/summit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;There, you can do any of the following three things, but at least do one before we get any further. I think it&#8217;s important to remind everyone that no decisions were made at the Community Summit. There are a few things that will come out of the Community Summit where the answer the way forward is really obvious. And so those probably will get done quickly thereafter because it&#8217;s just an obvious thing to do. It makes sense for everyone in the project. It makes sense for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress. Whatever reason.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those things will probably move quickly, but mostly not even mostly there were no decisions made. And so if it looks like something is moving quickly there, it is because it makes sense after the fact. So there&#8217;s that. But the three things that you can do in order to take part in this information gathering and sharing that happened at the Community Summit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, head over to make.wordpress.org/summit and just read the notes. There are a lot of them you can pick and choose based on the teams you contribute to or the topics that are specifically interesting. Or if you have been assigned to read one of these things, obviously, go ahead and read that. But find the notes read them. Take a look at the discussion as far as you can tell it happened and get a sense for what the essential question is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do while you&#8217;re there is that you can join in that discussion right there in the comments if you would like to. You can, if you feel like your perspective is not quite accounted for in that, obviously leave some comments and let folks know. But also, if you feel like your perspective was accounted for, but there&#8217;s also a very specific question that was not necessarily answered or not even brought up, share those as well. That&#8217;s stuff that we would like to know as we are working through this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that you can do is you can take those conversations, and if there&#8217;s anything that looks like it&#8217;s particularly relevant to your local WordPress community, absolutely take those there and have those conversations with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And once you&#8217;ve had those conversations, let us know what you thought also in those comments, or take it directly into your weekly teams&#8217; chat, either way. We want to hear what you think about the questions that were brought because you brought them to us. And so you should have an opportunity to tell us what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:39] (Music Interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:48] <strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;That brings us now to our small list of big things. My friends, there&#8217;s nothing but big things left for the rest of the year. And so here we go. Number one, uh, I mentioned it quite a bit. There&#8217;s a conversation, an ongoing conversation about the future of events for our community. Right now, there is an open call for ideas, new features for our NextGen WordPress events, especially on the page that exists on WordCamp Central.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we want to find the most useful and desirable features for a future homepage on central.wordcamp.org that would host a list of all of our upcoming WordPress events. And so we want your opinion there. Please let us know what would be especially useful to you as you are looking for WordPress events to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that we introduced 2024, the default theme that is coming with WordPress 6.4, was announced. We have had, I think, 32 contributors to it at the time of this recording. And yeah, it&#8217;s beautiful. It&#8217;s got a lot of different implementation options, a lot of default patterns, and curated patterns so that you can get exactly what you want out of that theme. I think it&#8217;s going to make a great default theme, a great starter theme for our final release of the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, speaking of 6.4, with the release of 6.3 behind us, we are working hard on bringing 6.4 to the community. You can get involved with the development of that. There is a core chat every Wednesday. It happens. I want to say at 21:00 UTC, but I don&#8217;t actually know off the top of my head. I just go when my calendar tells me to go, and I live in the central time zone. And so, my UTC conversion is not the best, but we will leave the actual information about that in the show notes so that you can see it. But you can also go over to make.wordpress.org, and then there&#8217;s a little card on that homepage that tells you exactly when those core meetings are, including the new contributor meeting, which happens every two weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the fourth thing is that there is a successful WordCamp US behind us. That is our final flagship event of the year, which is always exciting. If you missed it, for one, we missed you. And for two, we have you covered. We&#8217;ve got a recap of the event. There is a link to that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:15] (Music Outro)&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"15911\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WordPress 6.3.1 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/wordpress-6-3-1-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Aug 2023 14:43:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"minor-releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15886\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"WordPress 6.3.1 is available!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Jb Audras\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5097:\"\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.3.1 is now available!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This minor release features&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=6.3.1&amp;group=status&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=component&amp;col=version&amp;col=keywords&amp;order=priority\">4 bug fixes in Core</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/103/\">6 bug fixes for the block editor</a>.

On WordPress as a platform for empowerment and change, Josepha shared, “The more people that know about WordPress, the more people can access the incredible opportunities that WordPress can provide.” And that sustaining the platform for future generations ensures these opportunities will persist. She added, “We exist for as long as people want to use our software.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community is the key to sustaining WordPress, and Josepha touched on the importance of WordCamps, workshops, and events that create value, promote inclusivity,&nbsp; and spark inspiration. WordPress can be a catalyst for positive change in the life of a contributor, end user, or site builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concluding her keynote, Josepha asked the audience to think about the story they’d want to tell about themselves and their time in WordPress; and the story they would want WordPress to tell the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Next for Gutenberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EavRd7PtA0Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt began his keynote with a touch of nostalgia, referring to a comment on his personal blog in 2003 by WordPress Co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikelittle/\">Mike Little</a>, and then looked ahead to the most recent release, WordPress 6.3. As this year’s largest release, it includes new features such as the Command Palette, a quick way (⌘+k on Mac or Ctrl+k on Windows) to search your site and access common commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-3/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1024%2C535&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress 6.3 Lionel\" class=\"wp-image-15795\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1024%2C535&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=768%2C401&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=1536%2C802&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?resize=2048%2C1070&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/6.3-Release-Edition-Featured-Image.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt continued, “WordPress never rests, so right around the corner is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-4/\">WordPress 6.4</a> on Nov 7… with some cool new features.” He shared that 6.4, like 5.6, will be an underrepresented gender-led release. A new default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a>, is tailored for entrepreneurs and small businesses, photographers and artists, and writers and bloggers. Additionally, 6.4 will feature integrated font management and Image block options to expand single images for optimal viewing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking further into the future, Matt highlighted Phase 3 of the Gutenberg project, which will focus on workflows and collaboration, “moving WordPress from a single-player to a multi-player tool.” In that spirit of collaboration, a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C05PY7QLR5F\">#LMS</a> working group will also bring WordPress learning management systems together to improve the web standards for courses and learning content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Phase 3, Matt shared thoughts about what it means to support WordPress many years from now.

Enquanto isso, o trabalho fundamental continua para a Fase 3 do <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">roteiro do WordPress</a>. Continue lendo para alguns destaques.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conheça o tema Twenty Twenty-Four</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/08/24/introducing-twenty-twenty-four/\">Twenty Twenty-Four</a> é um novo tema padrão que será lançado com a versão 6.4. Com uma coleção versátil de modelos e padrões, este tema abrange uma ampla gama de casos de uso, desde empreendedores a pequenas empresas, passando por artistas e escritores. O Twenty Twenty-Four também enfatiza as mais recentes ferramentas de design e recursos de edição de sites, permitindo aproveitar a flexibilidade dos blocos e desbloquear inúmeras possibilidades criativas com apenas alguns ajustes. Acompanhe o progresso do tema e relate quaisquer problemas <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentyfour\">neste repositório GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gerencie as fontes de seu site</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>O WordPress 6.4 apresentará novos recursos de gerenciamento de fontes:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A biblioteca de fontes permite que você gerencie fontes em seu site, independentemente do tema ativo, assim como você gerencia mídias na biblioteca. Instale facilmente fontes locais e do Google e escolha quais ativar para cada tema. Este novo gerenciador de fontes é uma maneira poderosa de controlar uma parte fundamental do design e da marca do seu site sem codificação. Graças à sua extensibilidade, as coleções tipográficas personalizadas podem expandir suas opções de fontes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Por outro lado, o recurso fornece geração de estilo <code>@font-face</code> no servidor e suporte para impressão. Ele introduz uma nova função global chamada <code>wp_print_font_faces()</code>, que processa dados de fontes recebidos de estilos definidos no editor ou pelo tema ativo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Observação: a biblioteca de fontes está programada para inclusão nas próximas versões beta 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Adicione funcionalidade de lightbox às suas imagens</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Exiba suas imagens de forma interativa com a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51132\">funcionalidade de lightbox</a>. Este novo recurso principal estará disponível para blocos de imagens, permitindo que recursos visuais sejam abertos e ampliados sobre o conteúdo existente.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aproveite novas melhorias de escrita</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53305\">Muitas melhorias</a> na versão 6.4 garantirão que sua experiência de escrita no WordPress permaneça tranquila e agradável, desde novos atalhos de teclado até colagem mais confiável de outras fontes. Além disso, uma nova experiência na barra de ferramentas estará disponível para os blocos de <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53697\">navegação</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53306\">lista</a> e <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53699\">citação</a>, tornando o trabalho com suas opções de ferramentas mais eficientes e intuitivos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mais ferramentas de design, maior criatividade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Novas ferramentas de design irão melhorar a experiência geral de criação com WordPress, ao mesmo tempo que fornecem maior controle e flexibilidade de layout. Algumas atualizações incluem:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53934\">Imagens de fundo para blocos de grupo</a>, permitindo layouts criativos e personalizados.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54216\">Proporções para espaços reservados de imagem</a> – um novo recurso que é particularmente útil ao criar e usar padrões. Depois de definir a proporção desejada de um espaço reservado, você pode arrastar e soltar uma imagem e ela será ajustada para manter a consistência do design.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53667\">Personalização de cores de botões e cabeçalhos em blocos de grupos</a> e de <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54104\">colunas</a>, permitindo definir a aparência desses elementos quando colocados dentro desses blocos contêineres. Esse recurso dá um passo no sentido de permitir <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40318\">estilos específicos de seção</a>, que continuarão a ser desenvolvidos nos próximos lançamentos.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54416\">Configurações de alinhamento em padrões sincronizados</a>. Ao criar e converter um padrão sincronizado com blocos de largura total, alinhados à esquerda ou à direita, essa melhoria garante que os atributos de alinhamento permaneçam intactos para uma experiência perfeita de edição de site e criação de padrões.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Atualizações para fluxos de trabalho mais tranquilos</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>À medida que o editor do site continua a evoluir e expandir seus recursos, o mesmo acontece com a interface e as ferramentas que o suportam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduzida pela primeira vez no WordPress 6.3, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-command-palette/\">paleta de comandos</a> ajuda você a realizar ações, pesquisar e navegar rapidamente pelo conteúdo e configurações do seu site. Ele receberá atualizações significativas na versão 6.4, apresentando um <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53117\">design atualizado</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52509#top\">novos comandos</a> para realizar ações específicas de bloco e <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53496\">melhor linguagem de comando e consistência de ação</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/list-view/\">visualização de lista</a> oferece uma ótima maneira de navegar e trabalhar com os blocos que compõem seu site. Esta versão apresentará melhorias em sua interface e usabilidade, tornando-a ainda mais poderosa. Você pode <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53735\">renomear blocos de grupo</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53381\">visualizar mídia para blocos de galeria e imagem</a> e <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53559\">duplicar blocos com um atalho de teclado</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Melhorias de padrões</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Os <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-patterns/\">padrões</a> desempenham um papel essencial na edição de sites e sua importância permanece proeminente no próximo lançamento.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A versão 6.4 permitirá que você organize melhor seus <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/53835\">padrões sincronizados e não sincronizados com categorias</a> como parte do processo de criação. Essas categorias estão disponíveis para classificação no fluxo de inserção para facilitar a descoberta e adição de padrões. Além disso, você pode acessar convenientemente todos os seus padrões personalizados no mesmo lugar – a seção padrões do bloco de insercão, que remove a guia separada para padrões sincronizados.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outras melhorias incluem a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54337\">importação e exportação de padrões como arquivos JSON</a>, garantindo compatibilidade retroativa com blocos reutilizáveis e permitindo a transferência de padrões entre sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Por último, esta versão melhorará a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/52150\">compatibilidade com os temas clássicos</a>, usando as bases estabelecidas no WordPress 6.3 para criação e gerenciamento de padrões. Uma nova <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58827\">guia de padrões</a> no menu <em>Aparência</em> do seu painel concederá acesso à interface de padrões disponível no editor do site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Atualização (3 de outubro de 2023)</strong>: Embora a versão 6.4 traga vários avanços de padrões interessantes, a experiência aprimorada de gerenciamento de padrões mencionada anteriormente para temas clássicos, infelizmente, não será incluída na versão 6.4. Agradecemos a compreensão e fiquem atentos ao WordPress 6.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introdução a hooks de blocos</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59313\">Hooks de blocos</a> é um novo recurso poderoso que enriquece a extensibilidade dos temas de bloco, inspirando-se no conceito familiar de WordPress <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/wordpress-filter-hooks/\">Hooks</a>. Após a ativação, os plugins podem inserir blocos automaticamente no conteúdo relativo a outro bloco. Por exemplo, um bloco de botão “Curtir” pode ser inserido automaticamente após o bloco postar conteúdo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embora centrado no desenvolvedor, os hooks de blocos aprimoram a experiência do usuário, tornando o uso de blocos mais intuitivo e permitindo maior personalização e controle sobre onde e como os blocos inseridos automaticamente aparecem. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52969\">Um novo painel do inspetor de blocos</a> chamado “Plugins” foi projetado para respeitar as preferências dos criadores, garantindo que você possa adicionar, descartar ou realocar um hook de bloco conforme desejado.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Acessibilidade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>O WordPress 6.4 tem 70 melhorias de acessibilidade programadas para inclusão, 60 delas estão incluídas na versão Beta 1. Atualizações notáveis focadas em melhorar a experiência da interface do usuário (IU) incluem <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40822\">melhores posicionamentos de botões</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47125\">contexto aprimorado para itens de &#8220;Adicionar novo&#8221; nos menus da administração</a> e <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58573\">atualização nas mensagens na integridade do site</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Além disso, foram implementadas correções para <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58756\">edição de imagens na biblioteca de mídia</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30685\">relatórios de erros na tela de login</a> e <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58756\">configurações de “sem movimento” para GIFs</a>. A causa de alguns <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58703\">falsos positivos em testes automatizados de UI</a> foi corrigida, e usuários sem JavaScript agora veem um <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59229\">link direto para instalar o plugin do editor clássico</a>.

WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Agradecemos aos voluntários da comunidade que contribuem para os fóruns de suporte respondendo a perguntas de usuários do WordPress em todo o mundo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Envolva-se</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Se você gosta de contribuir com o WordPress, aprender mais e se envolver é fácil. Descubra as equipes que se reúnem para <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">criar o WordPress</a> e explore o roteiro do produto no <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">blog de desenvolvimento do núcleo</a>. Você também pode usar esta <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/\">ferramenta interativa</a> para ajudá-lo a decidir qual equipe é a certa para você.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Olhando para o futuro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Há 20 anos, em maio, o <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/\">WordPress lançou a primeira versão, 0.7</a>. O que começou com um post no blog do cofundador Matt Mullenweg e um comentário subsequente do cofundador Mike Little acabou evoluindo para a plataforma de publicação na web mais popular do mundo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O software WordPress continua a evoluir e iterar com base nas necessidades e desejos de sua robusta e diversificada comunidade de usuários. Esta versão é o marco da <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/02/04/phase-2-finale/\">fase 2</a> ao longo do <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">roteiro de desenvolvimento</a> do WordPress. À medida que a comunidade olha para o futuro, todos os esforços se voltam para a versão <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/05/wordpress-6-4-development-cycle/\">6.4</a> e, subsequentemente, para a transição para a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">fase 3</a>, que deverá introduzir poderosas ferramentas de colaboração na experiência de criação e gerenciamento do site.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:35:\"https://br.wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:11:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 15:17:23 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 03 Nov 2023 13:16:33 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:61:\"<https://br.wordpress.org/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:2:\"br\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:19:\"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}', 'no');

The Newspack project was launched in 2019 by WordPress.com, with support from the Google News Initiative, the Knight Foundation, and The Lenfest Institute. It provides local news organizations a powerful, yet cost effective publishing platform that promotes financial sustainability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 200 news sites are on the hosted version of Newspack, which uses WordPress.com&#8217;s cloud platform. Organizations can also host their own Newspack installations independently, which includes a theme, collection of plugins, and blocks. KinshiPress, which publishes news and updates for WordPress publishers, has <a href=\"https://kinshipress.com/newspack-self-hosted/\">a guide to self-hosting Newspack</a> that walks through the process of getting set up. It also mentions the drawback of the plugins being hosted on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Schweigert&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/aschweigert/newspack-plugin-update-checker?fbclid=IwAR1Z6GWoPLEQvBBuioWJP7wOxO6lRWgam2f1_2JXyTGeB248b6r1Qv6VOl0#newspack-plugin-update-checker\">Newspack Plugin Update Checker</a> solves this problem by using a <a href=\"https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker\">plugin updater library</a> that checks for updates and lets users know when a new version is available. The notice appears in the dashboard in a similar way to how WordPress.org displays updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1203\" height=\"107\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150980\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin checks for updates for nine of the most commonly-used Newspack plugins, including the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-plugin\">Newspack Plugin</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-ads\">Newspack Ads</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-blocks\">Newspack Blocks</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-popups\">Newspack Popups (aka Campaigns)</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-listings\">Newspack Listings</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-sponsors\">Newspack Sponsors</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-media-partners\">Newspack Media Partners</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-rss-enhancements\">Newspack RSS Enhancements</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/newspack-supporters\">Newspack Supporters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Schweigert noted that the plugin requires the Newspack plugins be in folders named using their respective slugs. Although the plugin allows users to enable auto-updates, he recommends keeping an eye on the <a href=\"https://newspack.com/release-notes/\">Newspack release notes</a> to be prepared for any potentially breaking changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KinshiPress author Steve Burge recently published an article on the <a href=\"https://kinshipress.com/newspack-ecosystem/\">Newspack ecosystem</a>, contending that Newspack has the potential to do for publishers what WooCommerce has done for e-commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s a big audience out for a publishing platform that is open source, highly extendable, and has the backing of a successful company and a strong community,&#8221; Burge said.&#8221; Where else can newspapers, magazines and radio stations go? They mostly go to WordPress already, but the platform we provide them could be much more targeted and helpful.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Schweigert&#8217;s plugin is a good stop gap measure, Burge said he thinks putting the Newspack plugins on WordPress.org and improving the documentation would go a long way towards expanding its impact.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 04 Nov 2023 03:30:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Handbook Updates Chapter on Block Templating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=150958\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-handbook-updates-chapter-on-block-templating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2584:\"<p>WordPress contributors have updated the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/\">Theme Handbook</a> to include <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/\">a new chapter on block templating</a>. The chapter covers how the WordPress block template system works, how to build custom templates and parts and include them in a theme. This is critical documentation designed to provide a learning path for those who are building their first block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored developer advocate Justin Tadlock announced the update on Twitter, noting that it also includes a couple of new docs in the Global Settings and Styles chapter for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/custom-templates/\">registering template-related features in theme.json</a>, and the same for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/template-parts/\">template parts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new chapter on block templating is just one part of a larger effort to overhaul the Theme Handbook for modern day WordPress.  Contributors are transitioning the focus from classic theming to block theming, with just one chapter in the handbook devoted to classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was created during a time when classic themes were the only method of front-end design for WordPress,&#8221; Tadlock said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2023/04/04/theme-handbook-overhaul-proposal/\">proposal to overhaul the handbook</a>. &#8220;Much of its content now exists in a transitory state between classic and modern block theming. This has created a scenario where the handbook sometimes reads more like patchwork than if it were built with a single vision. That is often a natural result of adding new documentation over years.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal does not recommend scrapping all of the existing content but rather carrying some of it forward to be updated and reorganized. A good portion of the existing content is still relevant to be migrated to the Classic Themes chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overhauling the Theme Handbook is a colossal effort that&#8217;s still ongoing. It&#8217;s being managed under a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/816\">tracking ticket</a> on GitHub. The new chapter better supports developers who are just figuring out how the WordPress block template system works, but there are many more chapters that need attention. Anyone who would like to get involved in the project can select any issue on the ticket to get started.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Nov 2023 19:36:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: Add Icons to WordPress’ Core Button Block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=150927\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://wptavern.com/add-icons-to-wordpress-core-button-block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5605:\"<p>Nick Diego, a developer advocate at Automattic and core contributor, is the author of the popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/icon-block/\">Icon Block</a> plugin that enables users to add custom SVG icons and graphics to the WordPress block editor. He is often asked if the plugin can add icons to the core Button block, but that is outside the scope of what it does. Last week he wrote a plugin that fulfills this feature request in a separate plugin without building a custom block.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Everyone asks me if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theiconblock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theiconblock</a> can add icons to the core Button block in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a>. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the answer is no. <br /><br />But while traveling last week, I built a little demo plugin that does just that.<br /><br />It works quite well, and no need for a custom block <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />… <a href=\"https://t.co/jF3T3T8lOA\">pic.twitter.com/jF3T3T8lOA</a></p>&mdash; Nick Diego (@nickmdiego) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickmdiego/status/1719871746818314361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 2, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Enable Button Icons plugin is <a href=\"https://github.com/ndiego/enable-button-icons\">available on GitHub</a> as an example that demonstrates how developers can lightly extend core blocks for features like this.

The new <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/products/wordfence-cli/\">CLI product</a> was <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2023/08/wordfence-cli/\">launched at WordCamp US</a> two months ago with malware detection capabilities, but the latest update brings in the most highly requested feature &#8211; vulnerability scanning at scale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence is most well-known for its Web Application Firewall, malware scanner, and login security product, which is packaged as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/\">a free plugin</a> and installed on more than 4 million websites. The CLI is the first-ever command line malware and vulnerability scanner for WordPress servers. It is targeted at developers, site cleaners who scan large numbers of files for remediation, agencies, and hosting companies that want to scan across entire networks of millions of customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Vulnerability scanning in Wordfence CLI 2.0.1 uses our own open vulnerability database,&#8221; Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder said. &#8220;The database itself is completely free for anyone to use, and includes APIs that are open, along with web hooks so that developers can build real-time alerting into their applications. Our mission is to secure the Web, and we think that having an open vulnerability database, with an open source, robust and high performance vulnerability scanner for servers furthers that mission.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability database includes responsible disclosures published by researchers for the benefit of the wider community.<br /><br />&#8220;Because most vulnerabilities come from the research community, we believe they are public property,&#8221; Maunder said. &#8220;While some companies do charge for their collection of vulnerabilities, we don’t think it is appropriate to resell public property, which is why we created an open and completely free vulnerability database.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CLI vulnerability scans use the Wordfence Intelligence Vulnerability API feed, which is free for both personal and commercial use. It contains more than 12,250 unique vulnerability records affecting 7,600 plugins and themes. The Wordfence team adds an average of 82 new vulnerabilities per week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 2.0.1, code named &#8220;Voodoo Child&#8221; simplifies installation so users no longer have to go to the Wordfence site to get an API key. The tool fetches the API key in the background to make it easier to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence CLI is licensed under the GPLv3 and <a href=\"https://github.com/wordfence/wordfence-cli/\">available on GitHub</a>, along with <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/help/wordfence-cli/\">documentation</a> for installing, configuring, and running the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wordfence CLI is one of those projects where the product roadmap writes itself because there is such an obvious need for a powerful tool like this in the WordPress server administration space,&#8221; Wordfence lead developer Matt Barry said. &#8220;We’re in this for the long haul and will continue to invest heavily in Wordfence CLI, with your guidance.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Nov 2023 20:48:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.4 Release Candidate 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=16247\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/11/wordpress-6-4-release-candidate-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8050:\"<p>The third release candidate (RC3) for WordPress 6.4 is ready to download!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how translations of the WordPress project are created now and in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Estela Rueda, Courtney Robertson and Javier Casares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney is a former teacher who now focuses on contributing to WordPress. With a background in education, she understands the challenges faced by English second language learners in the American education system. She&#8217;s passionate about providing access to WordPress in multiple languages, as she believes it&#8217;s unfair to expect non-English speakers to simultaneously translate content and understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Estela is a language enthusiast who has spent years navigating the challenges of website localization. As a member of the WordPress community, Estela has come across the intricacies of language differences, and the need for accurate translation in various Spanish locales. With 14 Spanish locales to handle Estela&#8217;s expertise in understanding the subtle nuances, and localizations of each language variation has been indispensable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Javier is a dedicated member of the WordPress community, with expertise in creating documentation. Javier has been instrumental in developing handbooks for various sites. However, there have been some technical challenges. Despite these obstacles Javier, as you will hear, remains committed to addressing and solving the documentation issues at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode covers the important topic of translations, and making WordPress documentation more accessible to people worldwide. Our guests bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table, as they discuss the complexities and challenges of language translation in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start by highlighting challenges posed in translating WordPress, such as the tangled processes currently in place, as well as more language focused topics. We talk about the extensive collaborative effort involved in translating WordPress, and the plans to expand translation efforts to documentation with the help of dedicated teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into how contributors might need to rethink how many of the current translation processes are structured. We discuss the different approaches needed for translating plugins and themes versus documentation. We touch upon how technical aspects of these processes such as content creation and updates also pose significant challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three guests stress the importance of global involvement in translation efforts, including translators, reviewers, and project managers. They advocate for the development of standardized style guides for each language to maintain consistency. And they explore the possibility of creating software, or tools, to manage translation tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney, Estela and Javier all acknowledge the challenges ahead, but express optimism that their ideas will help make WordPress accessible for all. Communicating how WordPress is built and how it works is an endeavor tightly aligned with the projects overall mission of democratizing publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Estela Rueda, Courtney Robertson and Javier Casares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by three fine people. I&#8217;m joined by Courtney Robertson, Estela Rueda and Javier Casares. Hello all three of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:48] <strong>Javier Casares:</strong> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:49] <strong>Estela Rueda:</strong> Hi Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:50] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very nice to have you on the podcast today. We&#8217;re going to be talking about WordPress translations, and the way that we can make it easier for people from around the globe to get access to WordPress documentation. It&#8217;s a very important subject and there&#8217;s been a lot of work, albeit that you may not know about it. There&#8217;s been an awful lot of work going on over, well more or less a decade, and we&#8217;ll find out more about that in a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first of all I think it&#8217;s important that everybody gets a little window to introduce themselves, do a quick bio. So if I take you one at a time and lets start with Courtney. Just tell us who you are. And I know that I&#8217;m going to say can we be brief but I know time is short, so let&#8217;s keep it fairly brief if that&#8217;s all right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Sure thing. I&#8217;ve been contributing to WordPress since 2009. A big part of the training team for many years. These days you can also find me over in Meta, Sustainability, and generally around the project on behalf of GoDaddy these days, and I&#8217;ve been there for about two and a half years. Long time contributor. Big fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much. I&#8217;m sure that people have come across Courtney in the past, as would be the case for the next two people. Let&#8217;s go for Estela next. Hello Estela, would you mind giving us your intro?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:01] <strong>Estela Rueda:</strong> Hi Nathan. Yes. I&#8217;ve been contributing for about five years already and I am mostly in the design and the documentation teams. But you can find me everywhere. I do mess around everywhere, I ask questions. And my goal has been to rearrange, recategorise the end user documentation. And that&#8217;s been the big project that we finished, it took us three years. And now we want to bring it up to the whole world in every single language we can manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay thank you. And finally Javier, if you want to just give us your short bio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:37] <strong>Javier Casares:</strong> Yeah. Hello everybody. I&#8217;m Javier Casares, I&#8217;m from Spain. I&#8217;ve been involved with WordPress since 2006, so more or less 17 years. I mainly focus on hosting, on the hosting team, and I&#8217;m helping the documentation team mainly with the Advanced Administration Handbook. So that&#8217;s more or less what I do. I do a lot of things but those are the main things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Those are the things which are pertinent to today&#8217;s discussion. Yeah, thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if, like me, you are a native English speaker, English is your first language. It may very well be that some of the things that we&#8217;re going to talk about today have either never occurred to you, or you&#8217;ve never bumped up against this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because broadly speaking, if you are a native English speaker, you can find the documentation, you can find tutorials. You can find almost anything you wish to find out about WordPress, how to use it, how to implement things and so on, by going and doing a Google search. And you&#8217;re off to the races because essentially everything has historically been done in the English language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess that, in my case, makes me an incredibly fortunate person. But that&#8217;s not the case throughout the world. And as obviously WordPress has grown, we&#8217;re now 40 plus percent of the internet, it would be not really serving the user base of WordPress if everything was simply in English. It would be a laudable goal to get everything translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I guess we should probably outline where all of the things are at the moment. So it&#8217;s not the case that you can go to one website and there it all is, open a Pandora&#8217;s box, open it all and there it all is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s outline that problem first. I don&#8217;t really mind who wishes to tackle this one. Yeah if somebody wants to just outline the problem that we face, where are all the documents stored at the moment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:23] <strong>Estela Rueda:</strong> I can&#8217;t give it a go. There are many, many limitations within WordPress. There are the sites that are called the Rosetta sites, or locales and those are the ones that are written in other languages for local teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then we have issues, different issues. For instance, in Spanish, we have 14 locales in Spanish. So we have Spanish from Spain, we have Spanish from Mexico, Spanish from Colombia, Spanish from Costa Rica, et cetera. And everybody will think, well don&#8217;t you understand each other? Yeah we do, we understand each other, but there are so many differences in our languages. And there is the localisation of the words, and a lot of little things that we need to figure out. That&#8217;s one thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the other thing is that there are never enough contributors to do translations. And then there are all the technical issues that we have, and Javier can talk to you about those, because he&#8217;s more aware than all of the technical issues that we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, in that case, we&#8217;ll hopefully segue over to Javier. Are you able to take it from there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:29] <strong>Javier Casares:</strong> Yeah. So the main thing is, we have the Rosetta sites. It&#8217;s local team can create their own documentation in a way, because some of the sites have their own handbooks. But there is some technical things there because, for example, the Spanish from Spain is one of the older sites in the WordPress network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s database is in LATIN1, it&#8217;s not in UTF, it&#8217;s a technical thing. But it doesn&#8217;t allow, for example, emojis in the database. That&#8217;s so simple but it&#8217;s something that happens. So we have some problems having documentation there. That&#8217;s one of the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the other one is we have the documentation right now in wordpress.org/documentation. Also we have the developer.wordpress.org. We have the Learn corpus also in with a lot of documentation. In a lot of ways, WordPress TV should, maybe it&#8217;s another place with documentation, in video in this case. And everything usually is focused on English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the main idea on this project we started like a year ago is, how can we translate everything into, more or less, at least eight languages? Because eight languages cover more or less eighty percent of the WordPress users. And also, where are we going to put that documentation? Because, for example, we can do ses.wordpress.org/documentation, that&#8217;s the easy one. But, for example, the developer documentation is in a subdomain so, where are we going to put all this documentation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s one of the things we are trying to solve. That&#8217;s one technical problem we have to face. And the other one is, where are we going to put all the documentation to be translated? Because we know that WordPress will be multilingual in a way in some years. I hope soon, as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have now the phase three, the collaboration part. But we have the problem that we cannot give access in this case. This is something concrete for WordPress, not for a translation or a documentation problem. But we cannot give access to thousands of people to the WordPress network, because it won&#8217;t be able to control the security and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We decided to start migrating or having the English documentation in GitHub. That&#8217;s one place. Also GitHub has natively, the Markdown editor, so with some commands and some things we can put everything there in a way that everybody can take the English document and translate it into their language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example I&#8217;m doing that, I&#8217;m starting to do that in a beta project for the advanced documentation. That&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been working on for more or less 8 months. It was a very difficult thing to arrive because it&#8217;s been a big problem. A lot of people have been involved, a lot of languages, people from different countries involved, a lot of teams involved. So it has been a very technical challenge in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much. I don&#8217;t know if Courtney wants to add anything to that before we move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:05] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yeah. So my background, before going full time contributing to WordPress, was that of a teacher. And in the education space within America we have a lot of ESL, English Second Language. So we have a lot of people that don&#8217;t primarily speak English, and it&#8217;s a disservice to them in the education system to expect them to understand the content on top of having to simultaneously translate a language. That&#8217;s a really big learning difficulty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I very much wholeheartedly believe in providing access for people to learn WordPress in their own languages. Down to reading the captions on videos. If you&#8217;re an English speaker I would encourage you to go over to wordpress.tv, try to find a video that is not in your language, not in your first language, and subject yourselves to reading the captions and think about how fair is that for the rest of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, in Learn WordPress we have a different workflow perhaps than the Docs team. So Docs again think of as the dictionary and the reference manuals, and Learn as the teacher&#8217;s spot to be, or the direct learner&#8217;s spot to go, if they don&#8217;t find reading the manual version to meet their learning style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s something that we very much want to consider. Some people need a little more instruction to be able to get the concepts. And so Learn WordPress exists for that, both direct learners and educators. And over there we do not get access to Rosetta sites and instead we rely upon one instance of Learn WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas in the Rosetta sites and what we&#8217;ve heard from recent episodes with Vagelis and Piermario, just a few episodes back. We could hear that from what they&#8217;ve shared in other parts of the WordPress project there are tools to basically make a whole separate locale instance going on. So if you were in Spain and you wanted to read the same type of content, you would have an entire version of the site that is just for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas with Learn WordPress, what we have going on is all the languages all smooshed into one site. And what becomes difficult is we don&#8217;t have good workflows yet established around if the English language version gets an update, how do I assess what content? I speak only a tiny bit of Spanish and a tiny bit of Latin, of all the things. Good conversation starters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you won&#8217;t find an easy way to identify even what the other topics are with the same title. Let alone somebody that can&#8217;t assess what that content looks like. So we have some locale ambassadors, Piermario is doing a great job with the folks based out of Italy on rounding up some efforts there. Margarita especially, is someone that&#8217;s participating with Piermario on identifying the content to be translated into the Italian locale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re basically duplicating the content, but just in other languages all under the same site. So that&#8217;s not the most efficient way and we&#8217;re using GitHub as well to do some of this work. We have GitHub issues that have a template. So think of GitHub issues as logging something on the WordPress forums, right? It&#8217;s about on par with that. But we prefill what the text of that issue is, and have a workflow to publish that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not necessarily in conjunction with what the English version, last update, is or plans of how do we maintain those updates? And then, how do we also look and see if the Docs team did a certain bit of update? And how do we find the polyglots that really like these specific areas? You can see this becomes quite a challenge as we&#8217;re looking ahead to Gutenberg phase four with multilingual support natively. We&#8217;re still a ways out from that, but you can see where this is something to start untangling and working on internally before we roll it all into Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it sounds like that this is a spaghetti of things just loosely held together simply by people actually understanding what the processes of the different teams are. But we don&#8217;t have this one workflow, which presumably is some kind of goal. But we do have a moment in time, which would be the release of Gutenberg phase four, where hopefully a large proportion of this would be either in progress or completed, because at that point WordPress itself becomes translatable. And I suppose at that point it would be incredibly useful to have this work done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want to touch on a couple of things that may have confused the listeners because we&#8217;re all speaking, probably in a bit of an echo chamber here. And so there were a couple of things which were mentioned. The first of which was Rosetta, that got dropped a couple of times, and it may be useful for people to actually know what that means. So if anybody&#8217;s willing to just very briefly explain what Rosetta is. I mean we know what the stone is and so we get the connection there but, what is that thing in WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:57] <strong>Javier Casares:</strong> The Rosetta sites are the locale sites in WordPress. So we have wordpress.org, everything is in English, it&#8217;s the main site. Most of everything is there. But, for example, for Spain we have es.wordpress.org, or for Catalan we have ca.wordpress.org or I don&#8217;t know for French we have fr.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are translation sites from the main site, but not everything is in there. There are the main contents, for example, the download page, everything is in your language. When you download the WordPress from that site, it&#8217;s in your language. It includes the translation files. But each site can be managed by different people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in Spain we usually publish one post every week talking about things. It can be translation from general post, or it can be local things about WordCamps in Spain or whatever. So that&#8217;s more or less the thing inside the Rosetta. It&#8217;s the technical name, the project, the Rosetta project is the name or the locale site. So that&#8217;s more or less the thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah thank you, that&#8217;s perfect. That explains it beautifully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that was mentioned was eight languages have been put forward as the language is to get us to 80%. So I guess it would be quite nice for the listeners to know what those languages are. I don&#8217;t know if a quick Google search needs to be done there, or if anybody&#8217;s got that information to hand. But it would be nice to know eight languages initially are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to know that isn&#8217;t the entire scope of the project. That&#8217;s more a, let&#8217;s get something over the line with these eight languages, as opposed to that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing and that&#8217;s all that we&#8217;ll ever do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:44] <strong>Javier Casares:</strong> Yeah. I have some information from the hosting team, and it was like, okay, I&#8217;m going to analyse where and what language are the most downloaded in WordPress. So these languages are not the eight most top languages in the world, they are are the most used in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the main idea behind having those languages as the main ones. German, more or less the 6% in the WordPress scope. English, the 48%, Spanish 7%, French 5%, Italian 4%, Japanese 6%, Portuguese 5%, and Russian 3%. More or less that covers the 80% of the documentation or languages that WordPress has installations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay thank you, that&#8217;s great. That clears that one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess we&#8217;ve highlighted a problematic past, well not really problematic, it&#8217;s just the way the project evolved where everything is done in a unique way depending on the team, or which part of WordPress you&#8217;re touching. And maybe this one is for Estela. The enterprise of this podcast really is to highlight some future where we improve things and we take things forward, and you have outlined, I guess a project is the best way to describe it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your idea? What is it that you want to happen in the future? We don&#8217;t have to create timelines or anything, but let&#8217;s just imagine that we&#8217;re a decade out from now and it&#8217;s all been achieved, what would be your north star for all of this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:16] <strong>Estela Rueda:</strong> This is where we are, you know where we are working at right now, where we are starting. I started with this Spanish team. They are my trial team. And the only reason why I started with them is because I speak Spanish and it&#8217;s easier for me to guide them. We had to start the project in, you know, baby steps, go little by little. The idea is to create a process or a model that we can replicate into other languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with the style guide and how to write documentation in Spanish, because we have many grammar issues with the language. First of all, you know, we have the way we address each other, like formal, informal or we have the language is genderised, completely genderised. Everything is either female or male, there is no neutral gender in Spanish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many issues that we need to address. And I&#8217;m pretty sure other languages have the same or similar problems in their grammar, you know, grammatically speaking. And we need to address those and, how are we going to use them in documentation, in order to make it as neutral as possible and as easy to understand? They&#8217;re going to be like, you know, writing rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have the translation of the sitemap. Now, what I did with the Spanish team, we spent during a WordC amp, a whole contributor day, translating the site map for end user documentation. But I sat the marketing, the polyglots, and the documentation teams together. And I told them, okay, we&#8217;re going to translate but I don&#8217;t want you to translate literally. I asked marketing, give us words that are searched for, that will help with the SEO of the site. So that way we can localise also, and we can increase the use of the translation of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, I guess we&#8217;re going to start working into translating documentation. We&#8217;re going to create teams, and we&#8217;re going to start working on it. My idea is to start some sort of triage hours with teams. And let&#8217;s say twice a month, to review what we have written and to continue writing and just that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I know that if I leave it to every contributor day for every WordCamp it&#8217;s just never going to happen. And this is something that we need. If we want to progress we need to work, you know, a little bit every day, a little bit every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we don&#8217;t put set goals then this is not going to happen. But that&#8217;s where I am right now. And I will reach out to the Brazilian team who approached me and may be the second team that I start working with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So Estela, just to be clear the intention here is to delve into, in your case, the Spanish language and come up with a rule set, like a workflow. Where, okay, if we receive things in English, these are the set of constraints that we&#8217;ve got when we translate into Spanish. So somebody who is new to the team would be able to look at those guidelines, the workflow document, whatever it may be and have a very strong idea of, okay, this is the way to do it. When you&#8217;re going from English to Spanish, this is how you do it. Have I understood that correctly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:29] <strong>Estela Rueda:</strong> Yes. But those writing rules, or the style guide, I call them the writing rules because that&#8217;s what they are. But I want to apply that for every language, just not for the Spanish team. And that style guide has to be according to the language grammar, not to what we like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In my head I&#8217;m seeing a website when you say that, but of course, you&#8217;re talking about the style of the language, in your case the sort of gender that you&#8217;ve got to go to and things like that. That&#8217;s interesting. And, can you give us some sort of insight into how that&#8217;s going? Has it proven to be fairly straightforward to put that workflow together or is it a really thorny thing to unpick?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:03] <strong>Estela Rueda:</strong> We are just at the beginning of it. I just pitched this idea at the WordCamp in Pontevedra, which was last month, two months ago. And I realised that I need to sit down and start writing. So I gave them some sort of topics that might affect the language, and gave it to the team, to the Spanish team actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are going to start writing the style guide. And I said listen, I write something, ideas that I have and if they are not okay, feel free to go ahead and edit and change them. And let&#8217;s see what affects us where. Is it easy? No it&#8217;s not easy. It&#8217;s going to be difficult because like I said, we have 14 locales, or 14 Rosetta sites, for 14 different versions of Spanish. And we need to come together to a point where, what is the most common use for everybody?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So this question is going to sound a bit meta, meta in the real sense of the word. You are creating a document which then you will be able to share to other teams in order that they can run their own process. So a silly example, the Latin version of WordPress would need to look at what your team have put together, how to go through the process? Which they can then implement with their own locale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:28] <strong>Estela Rueda:</strong> Yes. I will be documenting. Actually this week I&#8217;m going to publish a post in the Polyglots team regarding about this step one, step two. So what is the writing style guide and why are we writing it? And what happened to the sitemap and how we came up to what we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So just talking about it on this podcast, it seems like a fairly solvable problem, but of course when you actually apply thought to it, this really is a gigantic plate of spaghetti. There&#8217;s an awful lot to be unpicked. There&#8217;s an awful lot of work to be done. And I&#8217;m just wondering how you feel about this, whether you&#8217;re sanguine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not necessarily for Estela, it&#8217;s for everybody on the call. How you feel about whether this project is going to be able to ship its aspiration in the, well let&#8217;s say, it&#8217;s probably a matter of years not months certainly, but probably under a decade, before Gutenberg four comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it does sound, on the face of it, it sounds like you&#8217;ve got an awful lot of work to be done. If you complete the Spanish, then you&#8217;ve got to move on to another one. You&#8217;ve got to get people&#8217;s buy in, you&#8217;ve got to re educate those people who are contributing their time, as translators. They&#8217;ve got to be re educated to do it in a different way. How positive, sanguine do you feel that this is achievable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Nathan, I&#8217;ll jump in here. One of the ideas that a coach in my life has shared with me, the motto of this company is, a world that works for everyone with no one left out. And I think about that a lot in the context of open source, and how we make WordPress possible for the whole globe, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are trying to make this tool that we have available, be available for as many people as would have used it, and make the best of that situation. And if we take that backwards to a place where we might need a mindset shift to go on, let&#8217;s think about a couple of features in the WordPress project that have rolled out within the last few versions of releases, and the naming that goes into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know the community would like to improve how we name things from this outset, so that we don&#8217;t have to rename them later. So one example that I thought went really, really well is what became the Command Palette. The initial proposal was to call it something along the lines of Wayfinder. And one of the great insights, because we were able to identify and put this kind of call out across social media and other places, it was not something that was just buried and obscure over in GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was raised throughout the community and a lot of folks said, that doesn&#8217;t make sense in my language. If you do a direct translation this does not make sense. So it&#8217;s not just about translating after the fact, but it&#8217;s also about how we name things really even before it gets widely publicly released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s a mindset shift that I think, I&#8217;ll say as an English speaker, I really think that we need to experience more of being the second language to truly appreciate and understand the depth of why naming things matters so greatly. The depth of why we need to consider how this will work with other languages. Consider the workflow process. To the point where we&#8217;re not just, yes, it will probably remain English forward first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to always tuck in mind the processes that go on downstream after we get the thing out in English or what have you. What are we asking our translation folks to do, and how does this impact somebody in a different language? I learned that when Learn was added the navigation menu across all WordPress sites, that the way it had been translated, particularly into Russian, Olga caught this one, it didn&#8217;t make sense in the way that it was translated. And so we have to think about these things before we just ship sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have this intuition that if the Command Palette had been called something, even adjacent to the Command Palette, it would have stayed like that. It the controversy of it being so poorly named that led the community to sort of say, well that&#8217;s really not the right idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so sometimes I wonder if backing yourself into a corner is the best way to get attention, if you know what I mean. It&#8217;s probably not the desirable outcome but it is possibly a way that, you know, people get enraged by something and so they go out on social media and change happens more quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From what I&#8217;m hearing there Courtney, you&#8217;re basically making a moral argument for this. It&#8217;s the right thing to do. It doesn&#8217;t matter what the goal is, whether we achieve this in a matter of 2 years, 6 years, 10 years, whatever it may be. The journey is the important thing, making the steps now to make this possible is the important point, not the end goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:11] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Absolutely true. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess in order for this to happen, as with many things in WordPress, bodies need to be on the ground. We need people actually doing this work. There&#8217;s probably a whole lot of people listening to this who are already committing their time to translations, but there&#8217;s probably a lot of people who haven&#8217;t. So I guess we need to speak to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I suppose we need to reassure people that if in the future, if this project has wings and takes off and it all goes in this direction, that they will be educated in the new ways of doing things. But also a call out to people who haven&#8217;t yet committed their time and feel that they could commit their time. How do they go about doing it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s tackle it in two parts. The first one, to people who are already translating, will there be education materials? Will there be instruction as to whatever comes out of this whole process?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:04] <strong>Javier Casares:</strong> Okay. So for me, we will need two different teams. This is not a polyglots project in a way. Obviously everybody will be invited to participate on everything, but I don&#8217;t think that the same people translating WordPress plugins, themes or whatever, needs to be the same people translating documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in a way, at least for me, because I think those are two very different things. As Courtney was saying, translating a plugin for example, or WordPress per se, maybe you need to be a little more literal in the translation. But documentation is different because people need to learn about what you are explaining. So you need to relate with that person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in this case that&#8217;s the work Estela is doing. You need to know how to communicate to these people, and that&#8217;s very different than translating a thing. So for me, it&#8217;s not like translating documentation is adapting or doing your own documentation based on one in another language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we don&#8217;t need to have the same documentation because, cultural things or whatever. Because not everybody in all the countries, in all the languages, use the same tools, the same things. So that&#8217;s one thing we need to have in mind. For example, as I was saying at the beginning, I just started leading the advanced administration handbook like one year or two years ago. That&#8217;s something Milana gave me as a gift in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one thing I started, for me this is the pilot in the technical part, not in the documentation part. But now the only thing, or main thing we have in GitHub, in English, everything synchronised with WordPress, is the advanced admin handbook. So for me the next step is to do the technical part for this translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to check also the technical part because writing right is one thing, but doing the thing is another step we need to check. And that creates a lot of new problems in a way. Because we have new content, we have updates, and we have changes in the documentation. Because it&#8217;s not the same changing or creating a new feature, because I don&#8217;t know the command palette and everything. It&#8217;s a new thing from one, two versions ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need to create all the documentation. We need to notify everybody in all the languages that we have this new. So we need to translate everything and we need to check with the Polyglots team, how are you going to name the palette in your language and everything? Everybody should be involved in a way, because documenting in all the languages should be a global thing, not a local thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, the notifications. We need to have like three levels in the translation part, because we need the translators. We need people doing the translation per se. And we need something like the GTEs. So people can check that the translation is doing fine, the translation is right. And we need project managers because each documentation is not the same. The advanced admin handbook, the end user documentation, the Learn WordPress whatever, the plugins handbook, the themes handbook, developers handbook. Each documentation needs one or two or a team that can control the publication that everything is right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, one thing we talk in WordCamp US was how we are going to relate it&#8217;s language? Because we don&#8217;t have that now. So if we publish the documentation in Spanish and somebody wants to go from this page to another language, how are we going to do that? Because that&#8217;s not something we have now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are trying to solve phase four before we have phase four. So we have a lot of challenge in the organisation and in the technical part. Also with the translation or the organisation about how we are going to talk to people. Because, for example, the Spanish for me is one of the best examples, because in Spain we have a more direct, we talk to people and in Latin American they talk in another way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need to find like a common ground because we cannot maintain the Spanish documentation in 12 or 15 different ways. So we need to create a standard or international Spanish. That&#8217;s something that more or less exists, but we cannot create a lot of different documentation. So we need to have that in the translation part. We need to have that documentation, that style guide. We need to have one international Spanish because we cannot maintain, we don&#8217;t have a lot of people maintaining some little languages or whatever, because it&#8217;s not possible right now in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. That was really insightful. I got an awful lot out of that. I just have a little question off the back of that. So, is the intention then to build I guess more or less software to take care of this notification problem? And obviously there&#8217;s a lot more than notifications. There&#8217;s, you know, the work that needs to be done, and perhaps the order that it needs to be done, and who it&#8217;s going to be assigned to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the intention to have that as, if you like, paper based web pages or is the intention to have a piece of software that people can log into and assign themselves tasks, and offload tasks, and check things out, and then finally hit publish if something meets all of the different criteria? And it sounded like it was partially done but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s falling on your shoulders Javier. Just a little guidance around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:18] <strong>Javier Casares:</strong> Yeah. that was one of the main things we have pending. We started talking about this in WordCamp US, in the contributor day. Right now, for example, for the advanced admin handbook I&#8217;m going to lead everything in the Spanish part because I think we need to test everything, and I&#8217;m going to test this development part or whatever we are doing. I know Milana is doing it for the end user. She&#8217;s creating like teams in GitHub and doing actions and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s starting to automatising more or less the notifications and everything. So the main idea is we will have translation teams. So for example, the Spanish translation team, or the German translation team. And you will apply in those teams. And when something changed, in the English part, you will get a notification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, there is a new page. This document has changed because of whatever. So we need to inform people that we need a new version, or to update something, or to add something to the documentation. And then we need another step that when somebody translates something, it needs some checking or review or whatever. So we need like the GTEs in Polyglots more or less, the general translation editor. So people that know imperfection, the style guide or whatever. And they will check that this document is ready to be published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something we start talking and I think it will be something good for the project, is to create versions for the documentation. When we have 6.4 or 6.5 or whatever version, we can create a new batch of documentation, and we can create the 1.2 version of the end user documentation. So we can have a history of everything that changed, and we don&#8217;t need to put the documentation every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can have a weekly or a monthly updating. So it&#8217;s control, it&#8217;s more like the WordPress. So everybody will know where the new version is going to be published. If you need to add this document, priorities or whatever. So that&#8217;s something we are working on now, but there are a lot of people involved testing different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, Estela is doing the documentation for Spanish. I&#8217;m testing the technical part. Milana is testing this notification system. So we need to check everything because we don&#8217;t really know if this project is going to be real, but we think it will be. But we need to check everything, and we need to do this in parallel because we cannot wait to have all the work from one person to do the next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s something we are going to work on in the next contributor days in some places. At least in Spain I&#8217;m going to try to do this. And for example, that&#8217;s my next step in the documentation part, is going to test this technical part. How are we going to organise everything?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everybody is invited to participate. So if anybody wants to check things, we can talk. Probably in the Polyglots or the documentation channel in Slack. So I think a lot of people are doing the right steps right now, and before 2024 we have some pilot or something finished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you&#8217;ve ever been involved in creating software, you&#8217;ll know that the devil is in the detail. And although it&#8217;s easy to say what you&#8217;ve just said, I suspect that it will be fiendishly challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, good luck, I hope that your endeavors pay off. And it does sound like you would desperately want some people to cast their eyes over this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;ll get onto that in a moment. We&#8217;ll figure out a way where people can get in touch if they wish to. But you&#8217;re clearly all good people. You have the, what I&#8217;m going to describe as the right moral intentions here. You are giving up lots of your time for this worthy cause. Nobody could deny that this is a fabulous endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for people who are listening to this and sitting on the fence, thinking to themselves, what would I get out of translating? It&#8217;s a bit of an ephemeral question really, but I&#8217;m wondering if you could portray or explain to us, what do you get out of this? Apart from the fact that you&#8217;ve translated a software project, that much is obvious. But, do you get like a warm, fuzzy feeling out of this? Does it make you feel good? Is there a good community? Are there nice people sitting behind translation that you&#8217;ve become friends with? I&#8217;m trying to offer a path for people who kind of want to commit but haven&#8217;t committed, because they just see it as there&#8217;s more things to do on my plate each week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:13] <strong>Estela Rueda:</strong> I think that friendships, they just come. They are just like part of it. But that&#8217;s not the reason why I do it. For me it&#8217;s more about empowering people. I think that, you know, if I can translate more of the documentation in another language then there will be more plugin developers, or theme developers, or agencies in that country. And then you will empower people. You will empower more people because they will be able to start their own businesses, you know, create their own little plugins and start small like we all did at some point, and then become bigger and bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know, I kind of took into that Matt&#8217;s dream about a hundred years. I think that if we open everything up for more countries, more cultures to join, then WordPress will be bigger and bigger and more people will use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much, Courtney. I think maybe you want to chip in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:13] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> I really love solving complex puzzles. And so if we look, devils in the details. Relaying communications between docs and training becomes pretty important. So not only do we want to leverage Milana&#8217;s system about the GitHub actions, some of that automation work that can notify people in other languages. But also the communication between the teams about the same topics or the areas in which our topics overlap. It&#8217;s a fun thing for me to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then in addition, as I kind of look more broadly like Estela, I firmly believe in empowering others. And that&#8217;s really what open source and the four freedoms give us. You are free to do what you would like with this thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to make that possible my method is to solve big problems, I guess. To work on these interesting challenges so that more people can leverage what&#8217;s going on and get involved along the way, and have mentors and others to connect with. Because for every time that I felt personally like I didn&#8217;t know what was going on, or I didn&#8217;t understand the value that I brought, or understand how I could start contributing with something small, I want to remove those barriers for other people. I want to make their lives a lot better from that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What a fabulous set of answers. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re running short of time. I guess the only thing that we should say before we wrap up is to give out a shout to people who are sitting on the fence, who haven&#8217;t contributed so far. What is the best way, the quickest route to finding out more? Is there a particular page that you would highlight more than any others? Is there a particular venue to go to? Is this a contributor day kind of thing? What would you recommend? We could take that one at a time. So let&#8217;s start with, well let&#8217;s go back to Courtney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:05] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Sure. Since our process looks a little bit different than what you see in Docs, for instance, I would encourage folks to swing by the training team. You can find our main site at make. wordpress. org slash training. There is a handbook in our top navigation area and inside of that has some information on how to get started with content localization. I&#8217;ll make sure that we have all those show notes. As well as a GitHub issue to log if you want to take part in that translation effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for those inside the WordPress project that are really skilled with amazing things like GitHub Actions, if you understand how to make GitHub automate some stuff, there is a channel if you search for GitHub inside of the channels area, you&#8217;ll find a channel where we share tips and tools about GitHub activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much, Courtney. Estela, anything that you wanted to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:55] <strong>Estela Rueda:</strong> You can go into documentation Slack channels. We meet on Tuesdays, 2 PM UTC, and just join us. And then we can talk about it. We are trying to look now for Documentation writers, but they are also bilingual. So they do need to dominate at least one word so that they can help us in the future once we move into their own language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have, actually the documentation team is, most of us are non English speakers. English is not our first language, so we have a lot of people that speak other languages, and they do help when it&#8217;s necessary. Now, we have several posts. I&#8217;m posting, like I said, I&#8217;m documenting what I&#8217;m doing, and we&#8217;ll be documenting it both in Documentation and polyglots, and just pick it up from there. Join the polyglots team. They are open to every language, or every Rosetta side, locale team. They all need contributors. They all need translators. So that&#8217;s the best way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much. And Javier, if you&#8217;ve got anything to add there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:05] <strong>Javier Casares:</strong> Yeah. In my case if anybody wants to check the most technical part or be involved in the testing, they can ask me directly in Slack. Because right now it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m doing the test alone. I probably when I do the main testing, I will explain everything because we did the proposal in the make.wordpress.org slash project. You can look for a proposal, documentation, translation, localization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the main document explaining everything. It explains why we are doing this. How we are going to do that. I think, right now, Estela, Courtney, Milana, and I are the ones involved. So another way is to, at least for this project, is to contact us, and we will try to put you in the right place to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we are always open to help people. So another way is to contact directly to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, Thank you so much, the three of you, for joining us today. Thank you Courtney, Estela, and Javier. I really appreciate it. Obviously, a very complicated set of challenges to come, but hopefully with your and other people&#8217;s contributions, WordPress will be readable by all the world. Thank you so much for your contributions today.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/\">Estela Rueda</a>, <a href=\"https://courtneyr.dev/\">Courtney Robertson</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/javiercasares/\">Javier Casares</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney is a former teacher who now focuses on contributing to WordPress. With a background in education, she understands the challenges faced by English Second Language (ESL) learners in the American education system. She’s passionate about providing access to WordPress in multiple languages, as she believes it is unfair to expect non-English speakers to simultaneously translate content and understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Estela is a language enthusiast who has spent years navigating the challenges of website localization. As a member of the WordPress community, Estela has come across the intricacies of language differences and the need for accurate translation in various Spanish locales. With 14 different Spanish locales to handle, Estela&#8217;s expertise in understanding the subtle nuances and localizations of each language variation has been indispensable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Javier Casares is a dedicated member of the WordPress community. With expertise in creating documentation, Javier has been instrumental in developing handbooks for various sites. However, there have been some technical challenges. Despite these obstacles, Javier, as you will hear, remains committed to addressing and solving the documentation issues at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode covers the important topic of translations and making WordPress documentation more accessible to people worldwide. Our guests bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table as they discuss the complexities and challenges of language translation in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start by highlighting challenges posed in translating WordPress, such as the tangled processes currently in place, as well as more language focussed topics. We talk about the extensive collaborative effort involved in translating WordPress and the plans to expand translation efforts to documentation with the help of dedicated teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into how contributors might need to rethink the way that&nbsp; many of the current translation processes are structured. We discuss the different approaches needed for translating plugins and themes versus documentation. We touch upon how technical aspects of these processes, such as content creation and updates, also pose significant challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three guests stress the importance of global involvement in translation efforts, including translators, reviewers, and project managers. They advocate for the development of standardised style guides for each language to maintain consistency, and they explore the possibility of creating software or tools to manage translation tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney, Estela, and Javier all acknowledge the challenges ahead, but express optimism that their ideas will help make WordPress accessible for all. Communicating how WordPress is built and how it works is an endeavour tightly aligned with the project&#8217;s overall mission of democratising publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notes provided by the guests</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to offer non-English speaking people the possibility to access all the WordPress documentation in their language. To accomplish that we need to translate all the actual documentation at HelpHub, DevHub, Learn WordPress and some Handbooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, the problems are not to do the translations per sé, but where to put that in each language, how to get the updates from the English primary documentation, and then how to maintain everything in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we need to know where are we putting the documentation, because this project cannot wait until Gutenberg Phase 4. This means that Local Communities should be involved here (for example, where are we putting the documentation in Spanish? es.wordpress.org/documentation, developer.es.wordpress.org?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After having the right place&#8230; how are we going to know if something changes? The best way is probably using the same way we are translating right now: translate.wordpress.org, (GlotPress).

Yet, a quote always resonated with me: &#8220;If you&#8217;re born poor, it&#8217;s not your fault. But if you die poor, it&#8217;s your fault.&#8221; My humble beginnings never deterred my aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, my exposure to technology was limited. In our village, neither schools nor homes had computers or mobile phones. My fascination with technology was sparked by sci-fi movies I watched on television, where characters operated these machines called &#8220;computers.&#8221;. That first moment when I laid my eyes on a computer, I knew my life was about to change. The real encounter with a computer came in 2006 when a neighbor purchased one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading5985_7896f3-28 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Finding The Internet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2008, My family moved to the town and it opened up a world of opportunities. Later that year a friend introduced me to a Cyber Café, where for just 20 Indian Rupees (24 cents US), I could play games for an hour. After saving the money for two weeks, I visited the café for the first time. Over time, my interest shifted from playing games to exploring the computer itself. It was a Windows XP machine, and I recall being intrigued by its features. This exploration continued almost every month for the next two to three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2011, I had become proficient with the internet and was familiar with operating systems like Windows, Linux, and Mac. That year, my father bought me my first phone, a Nokia 7210 Supernova. While it wasn&#8217;t a smartphone, it sparked my curiosity about the creation of software and websites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I researched &#8220;how to make a website&#8221; and encountered HTML and CSS. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially overwhelmed by the complexity, I decided to push forward, and by the end of the year, I had launched my first website using an online builder and my Nokia phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading5985_4d0263-45 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Teaching Myself, Teaching Others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My passion for technology only grew from there. I self-taught programming languages like JavaScript, PHP, Python, Java, C, and C++. I also learned computer hardware maintenance and served as a go-to tech helper in my community. Impressively, I became a full-time Teacher and SysAdmin for a local school, managing five servers and around a hundred computers. All of this knowledge came from internet tutorials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I truly developed a passion for web technologies. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>My first encounter with WordPress.com in 2012 was underwhelming, as I perceived it to be just another blogging platform like blogger.com. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, a few months later, my discovery of WordPress.org profoundly shifted my perspective. By 2014, I had set up my own WordPress blog. Despite juggling a demanding college schedule and coursework, I consistently set aside time each night to keep up with the latest developments in WordPress and other web technologies. Much of what I&#8217;ve learned comes from the generosity of online communities. In gratitude, I&#8217;m eager to share my own experiences, hoping to guide others on similar paths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a teacher was a fulfilling and enjoyable experience. One of the highlights for me was the opportunity to share my knowledge with the children and witness their growth and development. Teaching stands out as one of the most rewarding endeavors of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading5985_5fbc60-f3 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Shifting Gears</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Driven by a strong desire to delve deeper into web technology, I realized I had become too comfortable in my current role, working as a Teacher. In October 2020, I made the difficult decision to leave my teaching position and venture into the realm of Web Technologies. This decision did not come easily, as I had no alternate source of income and my savings were limited, only sufficient to last a few months. For the next three months, I found myself unemployed, but I utilized this time to extensively explore web technology, with a particular focus on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite grappling with imposter syndrome at the time, I was completely unaware of its impact on me. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I found myself reluctant to apply for job positions at various companies, filled with doubt about my abilities, and questioning whether I had acquired sufficient knowledge or was proficient enough to undertake the work. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>What I failed to realize then was that all I needed was a little push—a smidgen of encouragement—to help me advance with the skills and knowledge I possessed. I am immensely grateful to Topher DeRosia for providing me with that much-needed push. His encouragement was priceless, and it spurred me to send my resume to three different WordPress-related companies. To my delight and relief, I received a response from one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From those early days in the cyber café to securing a position at rtCamp, my journey has been anything but ordinary. In light of my experiences and the passion I developed from my early encounters with technology, I secured a position as a WordPress developer at rtCamp in February 2021. This was a significant milestone for me, especially recalling my days without a computer in my village and the hours spent in cyber cafes learning the complexities of the digital world. The journey to this point was challenging, especially since I navigated it largely on my own, without a mentor or assistance from anyone./</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading5985_0a7790-86 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Because Of WordPress&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, working full-time with WordPress, not only am I able to comfortably cover my bills, but I can also provide for my family. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Most crucially, it has enabled me to fund my brother’s necessary neurological treatments. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m delighted to share that he has successfully recuperated and no longer requires medication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout this path, I&#8217;ve faced countless challenges, sleepless nights, and stress. Yet, one truth remains clear: moving forward, no matter the obstacle. Failures are just milestones, not endpoints. With perseverance, success is not just a destination but a beautiful journey. If you’re facing doubts about your abilities, remember, we all start somewhere. It’s the perseverance that counts.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/from-sci-fi-dreams-to-software-reality/\">From Sci-fi Dreams to Software Reality</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Tremi Dkhar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Rebrands as Woo\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=150841\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-rebrands-as-woo\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2569:\"<p>WooCommerce is <a href=\"https://woo.com/posts/say-hello-to-woo-com/\">rebranding</a>  to &#8220;Woo,&#8221; a shorter, more playful version of the company name that many customers are already using.  <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce\">Automattic acquired WooCommerce</a> in 2015, along with WooThemes. The open source commerce platform now powers more than 4.4 million live websites, including 33% of the top 1 million online stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rebranding extends to the Woo Marketplace, WooExperts program, and all other aspects of the Woo experience. It also includes a migration of WooCommerce.com to the <a href=\"https://woo.com/\">woo.com</a> domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;&#8216;Woo&#8217; is how many loyal customers have referred to us for years. And now we’re leaning into that name for our company and brand,&#8221; Woo VP of Creative and Communications David Callaway said. &#8220;It’s a fun, punchy name that shows how excited we are to empower success for merchants and developers. Switching to Woo.com is part of this larger strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The move to Woo also allows us to standardize and streamline the names of our products and services. For example, we recently renamed WooCommerce Payments to WooPayments, and we’re gradually changing other product names to support this simplified naming system and better connect our core software, extensions, and programs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Callaway also noted that while Woo is how they refer to the brand and company, WooCommerce is the open-source e-commerce platform for WordPress, Woo&#8217;s core product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woo Express is another recently launched product that already bears the shorter name. During the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-woo-2023-woocommerce-highlights-ai-powered-future-and-continued-core-blockification\">2023 State of the Woo</a>, delivered at WooSesh, the team highlighted a few milestones for Woo Express, the company&#8217;s all-in-one Woo plan hosted on WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure. It launched in 2023 as what the team described as “Woo’s biggest bet ever.” Free trials began in April 2023 and by July 2023, Woo Express had more than 1,000 customers.

Wrangling the data in a spreadsheet became too cumbersome, so Luehrsen launched <a href=\"https://www.wp-data-dashboard.com/\">WP Data Dashboard</a> over the weekend as a &#8220;centralized hub for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data across the WordPress landscape.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new website is currently tracking 6,017 themes hosted on WordPress.org with 250 snapshots. It offers stats and data-based insights for those interested in getting a bird&#8217;s-eye view on themes hosted in the official directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150818\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Right now, the WP Data Dashboard has one main function: It crawls the WordPress Theme Repo (API) and crunches the numbers to identify trends,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;With the data stored in my own database, I can analyze and combine it in exciting new ways.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Data Dashboard has two unique stats that are interpretations of the data available. The first is a &#8220;Usage Score,&#8221; which is calculated based on a theme&#8217;s active installs vs. total downloads:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>A high score indicates a theme that not only has been downloaded frequently but also remains actively installed on many sites. The score undergoes a significant decay if the proportion of active installs to downloads is low, indicating that while the theme might be frequently downloaded, it&#8217;s not retained by users. This metric provides insight into both the initial appeal of a theme and its lasting utility to users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The second unique stat is a &#8220;Diversity Score,&#8221; which compares the downloads of a single theme author to the overall theme directory (or a tag) and scales that value from 0 to 100:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>A high score indicates that downloads are spread across many authors, suggesting a diverse and competitive marketplace. On the other hand, a low score suggests that a few authors dominate the downloads, indicating less diversity. This metric provides insight into the variety of theme offerings and the balance of power in the theme marketplace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Usage Scores can be seen on the <a href=\"https://www.wp-data-dashboard.com/themes/list\">List</a> page, which is an index of all the themes, as well as on the <a href=\"https://www.wp-data-dashboard.com/themes/tags/\">Tag</a> pages.  </p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"739\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150825\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The Diversity Score is only displayed on the <a href=\"https://www.wp-data-dashboard.com/themes/stats/\">Stats</a> page as a percentage representing the entire WordPress.org ecosystem. The Diversity score goes up when the stats are calculated without the default themes, which get a large number of downloads from the same &#8220;WordPress.org&#8221; author every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1057\" height=\"808\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150826\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hluehrsen/status/1718689888848023568\">thread on X</a>, Luehrsen highlighted a few data points he has extracted so far from the dashboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Fun fact: Did you know that the most downloaded themes ever are Twenty Seventeen, Twenty Fifteen, and Astra?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Each has crossed over 10 million downloads! But only Astra managed to retain its users and remains today as one of the most widely used themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s somewhat surprising is the decline in downloads for the newer default themes. While Twenty-Twenty garnered over 8 million downloads, Twenty Twenty-One managed only 6 million, and Twenty Twenty-Two a mere 3 million.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may be related to the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/contentious-review-process-leads-ollie-theme-to-remove-innovative-onboarding-features-amid-stagnating-block-theme-adoption\">slow adoption</a> of block themes, which still <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11X38e9w86XcgT4tybqfjKhrL0PIbDlIsUEJwLiKtJ7Q/edit#gid=931695972\">appears to be stagnating</a> at the end of October. The number of block theme active installs declined from August to September, but is now inching its way back up to previous numbers.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1138\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150828\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Did you know that only 2% of overall theme downloads come from themes tagged as &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.wp-data-dashboard.com/themes/tag/full-site-editing\">Full Site Editing</a>&#8216;?&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;Given that they&#8217;re relatively new, it&#8217;s not too surprising!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked if he has considered trying to include numbers for themes like Elementor and Divi, which make up a large segment of the commercial theme market, Luehrsen said he would like to include external data but the compatibility of that data would be very limited, which in turn limits comparability with WordPress.org-hosted themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Have you considered trying to include numbers for themes like Elementor and Divi? At the very least using resources such as BuiltWith? Elementor’s are eye opening. Absolutely dwarfs everything. Divi’s also higher than any on that list. The fragmentation is huge.</p>&mdash; Carl Hancock <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png\" alt=\"🚀\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1e8-1f1f7.png\" alt=\"🇨🇷\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@carlhancock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/1718762077156757510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 29, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The WP Data Dashboard is a useful way to track trends in WordPress.org themes over time, and the site appears primed to add data for plugins at a future date. It would be even more helpful if Luehrsen could make some of the calculated data available for visitors at a glance, such as 2% of overall theme downloads coming from <a href=\"https://www.wp-data-dashboard.com/themes/tag/full-site-editing\">Full Site Editing</a> tagged themes. There are a lot of ways this data could be visualized with graphs and charts in the future, as the database adds more information over time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is <a href=\"https://github.com/luehrsenheinrich/wp-data-dashboard\">hosted on GitHub</a> under a GPL license, so anyone can dig deeper into the code to see how it works or submit contributions to extend its capabilities.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Oct 2023 20:30:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 65: Little Sun Success\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=16227\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/10/episode-65-little-sun-success/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21522:\"<p>Join WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy as she looks at a recent WordPress success story, the clean energy solution Little Sun, and learns about their WordPress story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Today, I&#8217;ve got a special guest with me. I have here a couple of folks from Little Sun, a nonprofit organization that recently moved its entire online presence to WordPress. And we&#8217;re talking everything from their mission statement and donations all the way to their blog and shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome both to the WordPress Briefing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:59] <strong>Ashley:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:00] <strong>Romane:</strong> Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We have with us Little Sun today. Can you start by introducing yourselves and your organization? Just tell us a little bit about what you all do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:08] <strong>Romane:</strong> Hi, my name is Romane Guégan. I&#8217;m a Senior Press and Communications Manager at Little Sun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:14] <strong>Ashley:</strong> And I am Ashley Mrozek. I&#8217;m the Senior Digital Manager.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So what does Little Sun do for the folks who are listening and maybe don&#8217;t know about it yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:22] <strong>Romane:</strong> Little Sun brings full power and light to communities that live off the grid, with the focus on sub-Saharan Africa because most of the people who lack access to electricity and need them. And we also inspire people to take climate action globally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:39] <strong>Ashley:</strong> So access to solar energy helps kids who don&#8217;t have electricity and study at night. They can complete their homework at night. If their schools are in a more rural area, they will have a light to kind of guide them back home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also work on a lot of electric vocation projects and hospitals. So we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re kind of supporting labors that are, are taking place in the evening, after the sun goes down, among other things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s, I, I think that that is one of the things that folks, probably most of my listeners, probably take for granted, like the easy access to light. And as we all know, the sun is around a lot. And so that is one of our most readily available resources other than potentially wind power. But I think that that is a great mission. And I really think that that&#8217;s wonderful work that y&#8217;all are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is there a particular reason that you focus on sub-Saharan Africa? Is that where you find a majority of people who don&#8217;t have access to that kind of resource are?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:43] <strong>Romane:</strong> Yeah. 70% of those people actually need in sub-Saharan Africa, where solar is actually a viable source of energy. Actually, it&#8217;s only 1% of solar, of the solar capital of the generation when we actually deliver solar energy there because there is so much potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That&#8217;s amazing. So you said that you all were funded in 2012. I imagine that your business has evolved over time. So, obviously, you all are WordPress users. That&#8217;s why we have you here with us today. But before we get into the questions about WordPress itself. Why don&#8217;t you tell us a bit about how your business needs evolved over time and how you wound up needing a solution that did use WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:31] <strong>Ashley:</strong> So I would say our focus and kind of the different initiatives that we&#8217;ve taken on since 2012 have shifted a lot based on various reasons, where our donors are, where we&#8217;ve kind of found the most need, and where we can be the most impactful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think as we go into those new geographies, our online presence has become more and more important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, before you all switched to WordPress, I understand that you had several sites that you had to merge into one. And so I assume that as you evolved the business and your focus has changed, you realized you needed something a bit more streamlined. So, how was that transition, that migration from a lot of different sites to one big site?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:17] <strong>Romane:</strong> Yeah, because we started as a global project. And then, with the time, we evolved, actually also getting new donations. And in the past, we used to have one website where we have our webshop and our mission, our vision, all of our project descriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then we had another website only for the foundation. And then you had another foundation in the U.S. So it was the question, okay, how do we put everything together? So we actually switched from littlesun.com to littlesun.org with WordPress, and it was amazing to see how we managed with the team to create an ecosystem approach, including impact, but also sales, and fundraising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That was a big footprint that you all had, and you kind of consolidated it into one. And for all of our folks listening on the podcast, I&#8217;m going to include some links, not only to their site but then also to a few other things that we&#8217;ve mentioned in here today. So, since you made that change, how has it, how has that impacted the way that you all work with your site or with your online presence?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] <strong>Ashley:</strong> Yeah, I think using WordPress and having access to WordPress has been hugely valuable for us. We&#8217;re a small team, we&#8217;re a nonprofit, so it is pretty scrappy. Everyone is kind of doing a lot of different things. We don&#8217;t have a dedicated development team. And so being able to easily customize our pages and create new landing pages or make adjustments on the site without that development help has been valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, so you don&#8217;t have a developer team now. Did you have a developer team when you had all the sites?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:01] <strong>Romane:</strong> We just still work with freelancers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Okay, yeah. I am also not a developer, for what it&#8217;s worth, and have been working with nonprofits for a while. And I understand that problem where you have all these things you need to do and want to do, but there are also things you absolutely have to focus on in order to make your mission possible and your vision come true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:23] <strong>Ashley:</strong> Yeah, and I think, I think WordPress has given us a lot more, like a lot more flexibility to kind of produce new content quickly. And because of that, it&#8217;s just been a lot more efficient, too, for us, you know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And you all are using Blocks? Are you, like, the best Block builders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:42] <strong>Romane:</strong> Yeah, I love Blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:43] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Blocks are a fairly new innovation for the history of WordPress. WordPress has been around for 20 years, so we&#8217;re a nice, mature project. And we&#8217;ve really only had blocks as a functional part of the CMS for probably the last five or so. We&#8217;ve been working on the project a little bit longer. And it has been fascinating to me, like, in my own work that I have done with WordPress, kind of outside of my work with the project, to see, like, how much autonomy you get to have back as somebody who is not a developer, maybe isn&#8217;t a designer, but you do know exactly what you need to have on your site today, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And having to stop and find a freelancer or stop and find some set of developers who can make those changes. For me, when I was specifically working on nonprofit stuff. That was always kind of a moment where I was like, well, I guess I&#8217;ll just go to Facebook and put that on there or something because I was faster than trying to find someone to come help you. And so, I&#8217;m so glad you love the block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:48] <strong>Ashley:</strong> We&#8217;ve created many a landing page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:50] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Also, your site is adorable, and your brand is adorable, in case no one&#8217;s mentioned that lately. Super cute. Super cute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, we&#8217;ve talked about how you kind of took a bunch of stuff and made it into one big thing and how that&#8217;s been easier for you all to manage it. But from the standpoint of just, like, somebody who&#8217;s running a nonprofit, someone who&#8217;s running an organization, how has that transition been for your team? I know you said you don&#8217;t have a huge team, but was the move toward WordPress a net benefit over time, or was it immediately beneficial? Like, how has that been for your team? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:27] <strong>Romane:</strong> So what&#8217;s interesting actually is that we have a team that is spread also all over the world. And so we have teams in Berlin and in U.S., and New York. In Zambia, too. What was really interesting was how people identify to the new website because now we have to really think, okay, what is the content we want people to see, but also we want our critics to see. And so it kind of unified all of our content at Little Sun. And it was much more like much easier to understand afterwards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Romane:</strong> And it was because we also work at the intersection of creative communications, impacts, fundraising, technology, and to be able to put everything and have it on the front. And then have the stories to tell the stories from sub-Saharan Africa, from universities who got either a Little Sun lamps or solar systems, and then we have the donation page, so basically everything could be integrated in a super easy way, and it could target different audiences easily, either it&#8217;s someone who wants to partner with us, or a donor, or just someone who wants to be part of our solar training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, and I mean, I think that no one will be surprised to hear that if you have multiple things that you have to get everybody to, it really increases the amount of marketing that you have to accomplish, rather than having one place for everyone to go too, and they can see everything that they might want once they arrive. So, that&#8217;s wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:06] <strong>Ashley:</strong> I think I was just going to say, or kind of echo what Romane said about the fact that we have so many different audiences, we have partners, we have donors, we have people who are just coming to learn about solar energy, or who are interested in purchasing a lamp. I think prior to this, it was a little bit confusing for those different audiences to kind of navigate to where they were intended to go to on the site, and now it&#8217;s much more cohesive. And we often hear that from people where it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s quite easy to, to kind to find what they need to find on the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I define the WordPress community as anyone who is using WordPress, regardless of whether they know it or not. And so you all, in my mind, are part of the WordPress Community. And I just wondered if being part of that community has changed your approach to the way that you manage your content online or the way that you have chosen work with your business as like an online entity that also does on-the-ground, in-person thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:06] <strong>Ashley:</strong> I think definitely. I think we&#8217;re kind of going back to what I said before. I think we&#8217;re much more efficient now. I think in the past, it&#8217;s the idea of, like, well, getting this web page live or publishing this is going to be, you know, we have to think about a huge timeline, that&#8217;s, is going to require a lot of resourcing, a lot of different types of expertise and people, and everything now feels like something that we can, we can launch pretty immediately, which is really wonderful too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would also say just like being a part of the WordPress community too. It&#8217;s the sort of support that we&#8217;ve gotten from your team. It&#8217;s always really tailored. And I think as a nonprofit working with a, like, a much bigger business, you can be apprehensive sometimes, feeling like you won&#8217;t really get that personalized support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been so nice with WordPress. Is really feeling like the people we&#8217;re working with are understanding our business and taking the time to understand our needs. And I think that makes us think differently about our online presence as well because then we feel like we have that additional support, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m always a fan of hearing that people who are passionate about WordPress are also passionate about helping others with WordPress. That&#8217;s one of my favorite things about us. That&#8217;s not true. I have like 25 favorite things about us. And so I need to stop saying that I have one favorite, but I never will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, well, do you all have any last thoughts that you just want to share with me or podcast listeners that we have?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:36] <strong>Ashley:</strong> Yeah, I think the, the plugins and integrations have been really useful for us. I think it can be really intimidating to bring on, like, a new tech solution or tool and feel like everything that you are already working with or have is going to become outdated or obsolete in some way. And I think it&#8217;s just been really nice to work with WordPress and have all of those transitions be really seamless for everything to connect really well. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s been. That&#8217;s hugely helpful too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, was that part of the decision-making process? Like, do I know that this software will be around in the future so that you&#8217;re making an investment in the site now and know that it&#8217;s going to hang around now you can find people help? Like, was that part of the decision-making process?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:21] <strong>Ashley:</strong> I think so. I mean, I guess I wasn&#8217;t completely around during the time, but I would say, like, that&#8217;s definitely something that we&#8217;re considering in any kind of tech that we&#8217;re thinking about is it can require so much work to, to kind of bring something on with such a small team. So we want to ensure that, yeah, it&#8217;s going to last, it has longevity, and it&#8217;s going to work with the tools that we already have. So I think all of that is really important for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:48] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Well, thank you both so much for joining me. Like I said, we&#8217;ll have a link to littlesun.org in the notes so that you all can learn more about their project and see their beautiful site with their beautiful little solar sunflowers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you both for being with me today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:04] <strong>Romane:</strong> Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:05] <strong>Ashley:</strong> Thank you so much for having us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:07] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> What a wonderful organization. I&#8217;m so glad that they found WordPress and that it works for them. Let&#8217;s continue our tour today with the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Item number one, it&#8217;s time to save the date: December 11th, 2023, for this year&#8217;s State of the Word. State of the Word is the annual keynote address delivered by the WordPress Project co-founder Matt Mullenweg. Every year, the event shares reflections on the project&#8217;s progress and aspirations for the future of open source. And so, if that is something that you like to tune into, December 11th is your day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing on our list is that we are celebrating our 10,000th photo submission. So, on October 11th, the 10,000th photo was approved. The Photo Team is one of the newest ways to contribute to the WordPress open source project, and it feeds all of those photos into Openverse as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing on our list today is that I want to tell you about a community team training module that just came out. It&#8217;s specifically about the Translate Live tool, and it is ideal for presenting at your local meetups to engage and onboard new translators for your native language. If you&#8217;re organizing a WordCamp, consider introducing this tool during your Contributor Day. I will leave a link for this in the show notes so that it is easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And item number four, the journey to update WordPress.org, continues with the launch of a new Showcase design. The Showcase is a natural starting point for a lot of visitors who are on WordPress.org. It inspires creativity and also demonstrates what&#8217;s possible with WordPress. So, stop on by there, it&#8217;s WordPress.org/showcase, and give it a bit of a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. And don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever a new episode drops. And if you like what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard today, you can share those with me at wprebriefing@WordPress.org. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:24] (Music outro)</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Oct 2023 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 16.9 Lets You Rename (Almost) Any Block, Adds Experimental Form and Input Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=150720\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-16-9-lets-you-rename-almost-any-block-adds-experimental-form-and-input-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4201:\"<p>Delivering on an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42605#issuecomment-1475904839\">highly-requested feature</a>, Gutenberg contributors have made it possible to rename almost any block in the List View. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/25/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-9-25-october-2/\">Version 16.9</a> was released this week with the new feature, which builds on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-7-27-september/\">Gutenberg 16.7</a>&#8216;s introduction of the ability to rename Group blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works in a similar way to naming Photoshop layers.

This is especially important if your Groups represent distinct &#8216;sections&#8217; of a given page/template.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every block can be renamed with the exception of these four:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>core/block</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>core/template-part</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>core/pattern</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>core/navigation</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>More renaming capabilities have been added in 16.9, including the ability to duplicate and rename patterns, as well as pattern categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44214\">introduces new experimental form and inputs blocks</a> to allow building basic forms.

A very early version is available under Gutenberg > Experiments, under the &#8220;Form and input blocks&#8221; experiment setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Why has there been no proactive outreach to the many developers of longstanding WordPress form solutions currently used by millions and millions of WordPress sites?&#8221; Gravity Forms co-founder Carl Hancock commented on the PR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It seems like proactive outreach to people who are experts in this space and who could do the most to help drive adoption (beyond comments/search/etc.) would have been a good thing. On many levels. Trying to get them on board with contributing, learning from their shared historical knowledge, and even more important of all&#8230; building on top of it and adopting it instead of introducing a point of more fragmentation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The forms feature is still in the very early stages of experimentation, and more information may be published to the November edition of &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/174\">What&#8217;s New For Developers?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other notable highlights from this release include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New media categories: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55236\">Audio and Video</a> for organizing patterns by media type</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55388\">Sort pages by date</a> in the Site Editor&#8217;s page management screen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Command Palette now shows <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53539\">block-specific commands as contextual suggestions</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Experiments: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55246\">Added featured image field</a> to the page list</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the release post for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/25/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-9-25-october-2/\">Gutenberg 16.9</a> to see the full changelog and more details on bug fixes and enhancements to performance, tooling, documentation, code quality, and accessibility. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 22:00:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.4 Disables Attachment Pages for New Installations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=150736\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-disables-attachment-pages-for-new-installations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4090:\"<p>The upcoming 6.4 release, expected on November 7, will <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/\">disable attachment pages for new installations</a>. Up until now, WordPress automatically created attachment pages when users upload a file through the media upload system. It has been treated as a special post type that holds information about the file and each attachment is accessible under its own URL. SEO plugins have been redirecting attachment pages for years, as they rarely have any significant purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Until WordPress 6.4 was released, WordPress created attachment pages by default for every attachment uploaded,&#8221; WordPress contributor Joost de Valk said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/\">dev note</a> for this <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57913\">change</a>. &#8220;On the vast majority of sites, these attachment pages don’t add any meaningful information. They do, however, exist, get indexed by search engines, and sometimes even rank in search results, leading to bad results for users and site owners.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be no changes to existing sites. They will continue to work as they always have, but new sites will have their attachment pages redirected to the attachment URL. Site admins who want to enable or disable attachment pages can use the new  <code>wp_attachment_pages_enabled</code> database option to control attachment pages&#8217; behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no interface for changing whether a site disables attachment pages, which was somewhat controversial in the comments on the Trac <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57913\">ticket</a> and the dev note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In light of the WordPress mantra &#8216;decisions, not options,&#8217; we’ve decided against making a setting for this,&#8221; de Valk said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress plugin developer Sybre Waaijer mades a case for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/#comment-45721\">giving users an option</a> with an interface for toggling it on or off:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The problem with filtering options is that when another&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;provides the option toggle, the option&nbsp;filter&nbsp;will go against user expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where “decisions, not options” becomes paradoxical because we’re now deciding to set an option while also not giving the option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as plugins fill in this gap, then A) where will plugins put the option (likely on their custom page instead of options-media.php), and B) of the dozens of types of plugins that are in the market to juggle this, who will ultimately be in control of the option?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s a filter, each plugin promises to set a toggle via a simple condition. But since it’s an option, plugins can add an option to filter an option and add an option to toggle the option. It’ll become a source of bugs because of the logical biconditionals (XNOR).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While an interface isn&#8217;t in the cards for WordPress 6.4, and may never be back on the table for consideration, contributors are discussing the possibility of putting this in a core plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Should we not have a core plugin for re-enabling attachment pages on new sites?&#8221; Automattic-sponsored contributor Justin Tadlock said. &#8220;If there’s not going to be a UI for this, then a plugin that’s not buried in a Trac ticket would be ideal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>de Valk agreed this would be a good idea to have a plugin that simply adds a setting to the Options -> Media page. Users likely will not understand the purpose of attachment pages unless they are looking to enable them for a specific, niche use case. A plugin like this would be useful for those who are not able to write the code to change attachment pages&#8217; behavior, as described in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/\">dev note</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 17:42:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Do The Woo Community: Never Say Never with LinkedIn\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=77372\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://dothewoo.io/never-say-never-with-linkedin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:363:\"<p>I have had many people in the WordPress and WooCommerce space ask me why I use and like LinkedIn.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the recent merger of 10up and Fueled, as well as some thoughts on how WordPress will adapt with AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcasts players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Jake Goldman. Jake is the president and founder of 10up, a digital agency that builds websites and tools for content creators, leveraging open platforms like WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start the conversation with an exploration of the recent merger with 10up, Fueled and Insignia. For many years 10up has been one of the leading enterprise WordPress agencies. With a roster of well-known clients, Jake has grown the company from himself to hundreds of employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst the journey has been exciting and challenging, Jake talks about some of the areas in which 10up has not been able to compete, and how the merger with Fueled will enable them to position themselves for projects which used to be out of reach. Fueled brings their experience of crafting mobile experiences, and Insignia brings their financial expertise, as well as the industry connections they have built up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jake shares how this new venture will continue to leverage WordPress as their CMS of choice. These new partners understand and support 10up&#8217;s commitments to contributing to WordPress. There are no plans to immediately alter the structure of either 10up or Fueled. It&#8217;s more about building an understanding of the capabilities of each partner, working towards a future in which the company grows into one entity over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the intentional pursuit of potential partners, and Jake reflects on the importance of cultural alignment and connections. He shares how his prior experience has shaped both his personal journey as a leader, and the success of 10up. And we explore the milestones, challenges, and key moments that have brought them to where they are today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we pivot to talk about the role of AI in the future of WordPress. It&#8217;s clear that AI is coming, and it&#8217;s coming rapidly. Any agency working with WordPress would find this topic hard to ignore. But what impact will it really have? Are we expecting entire websites to be built in seconds by just clicking a button?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jake expresses his view that these tools are to be seen as accelerants, complementing human website development, rather than replacing it, particularly at the enterprise level. We delve into 10up&#8217;s ongoing exploration and experimentation with AI, discussing some of the tools they have freely released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in how enterprise agencies grow or the future of AI with WordPress, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, without further delay, I bring you Jake Goldman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Jake Goldman. Hello Jake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> Hey!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very nice to have you on the podcast today. Really appreciate you joining us. Jake is joining us from 10up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10up very recently had some really quite seismic news. In the WordPress community 10up is one of those companies that you have probably heard of. They&#8217;re an enterprise level agency, they deal with some of the largest projects in the WordPress space, and they had some news around a merger. So we&#8217;ll get into that in a little bit and we&#8217;ll also get into some AI topics probably towards the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to that though Jake, I&#8217;ve just given a little bit of an introduction about where you work, but I&#8217;m curious about your backstory, particularly as regards WordPress, this is after all a WordPress podcast. So would you mind just giving us a little bit of your backstory. Where you fit into the WordPress ecosystem? What is the company that you work for and how did you set that up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> Sure. I&#8217;ll see if I can do this concisely. I feel like there&#8217;s so much to the backstory. 10up today is a shop that I have run for twelve and a half years now, as we&#8217;ll talk about. Part of a larger organisation. We are a web agency and we have been very proudly advocates of open source, open technologies, WordPress is our tool of choice. We also very much believe apropos of open source and giving back to the web, and helping continue to make the web an open platform where people, you know don&#8217;t have to pay huge licensing fees to be involved, be able to make websites, be able to learn new technologies and new skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we very much believe that as we have climbed up that ladder of an open web that we need to keep that ladder extended to the next generation. So we are also very large contributors to the project, we donate thousands of hours every year to open source. A large part of that goes to WordPress Core. Goes to a rich ecosystem of extensions that we contribute, that we think solve some hard problems, particularly in the enterprise, the kind of customers that we serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before this new event, just as 10up we&#8217;ve been about 300 people. That is a company that has grown organically from 2011 when we were founded, with just me writing code and doing a little bit of UX, and doing all the business side of things and built it sort of brick by brick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got into WordPress circa 2007, 2008. I was working at a shop as many were at the time focused on commercial CMSs and closed platforms. We kind of wanted to diversify, saw the writing on the wall. Started exploring with different popular open platforms at the time that was WordPress. One of the partners in that company was focused on Drupal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I saw a lot of potential in that platform that came, I thought, to pass over the next few years, and when it was time for me to go out on my own and start my own business, I was pretty determined that if I believed in an open web and wanted to see open technology thrive, that WordPress was a good horse to bet on. And so started 10up. Determined to become one of those agencies of record in the space. I guess the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did you have any intuition back then that WordPress was, you spoke about it in terms of it being you know a good horse to back. Did you have any intuition that it was the horse to back? Or would you have been prepared at any moment to swap horses mid race you know had Drupal pushed ahead? Because I had all sorts of intuitions, many of them which turned out to be completely wrong in terms of Drupal and other open source platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And eventually after WordPress became successful, I joined that ecosystem. But it sounds like you made a bit of a serendipitous choice. It was a bit of good luck possibly. And I wonder what your thoughts are around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:38] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> Yeah I mean there&#8217;s always an element of luck. I could have chosen never to look at WordPress, right? Or taken it seriously as a platform. I certainly thought I saw potential. I mean, you work in web from 1996 to 2007, you&#8217;ve tried and dabbled in lots of different technologies. I think it was, maybe this is the older man in me speaking now, but I think it was easier at the time to move between different technologies. There wasn&#8217;t so much friction trying new things, trying new platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As somebody that&#8217;s very, that likes engineering, and likes tech, and likes the geeky side but also has a strong appreciation for user interface and making things easy and putting myself in the shoes of people that are actually just trying to publish something on a website. Actually trying to manage content, always wanting throughout my entire time in web to be able to like hand off a website, maintain it, but be able to hand off and have a delightful experience for those website owners to keep updating their website and managing the content on their website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was very clear to me even 2008, 2009, I think it was around the time of the first big UI change in WordPress, you know the menu on the left and still elements of that echos of that design today in WordPress. It was very clear to me that in terms of platforms that we&#8217;re creating really focused on, what is that website owner, what is that content publisher experience that WordPress was, I thought, just running circles around the other platforms?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I saw a lot of potential. I was experimenting with even doing things that were custom post type like before there was really custom post types in core, and saw where the core project was heading in terms of adding more taxonomy support, adding more different content types and some of those fundamentals of a bigger CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess a bit lucky that I happened to be stumbling and playing and looking closer at the platform at the time, but I guess the short answer is yeah, I mean it was very palpable to my instincts that this thing was going to go places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you were to look back over the time since 2011, that number of years, the ground will be littered with people who tried to do what you did, but didn&#8217;t quite make it. You know they endeavored to have an enterprise level agency, they wished to grow their agency. But for some people clearly that worked, you being one of them. For other people, perhaps it didn&#8217;t work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering if you&#8217;ve got any intuitions as to what the key moments were in those years. If you look back and think, okay that was the moment, that was another moment, that was a third moment. What were the pivotal bits, the decisions that you made, the projects that you took up, which allowed you to become the sort of force that you are now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:48] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> It&#8217;s a great question and, you know, I&#8217;ll be earnest, I never really look at the sort of long journey and arc as, it&#8217;s nice to think of it as like there was this moment and everything changed. But it wasn&#8217;t really like that. It was a brick by brick, year over year kind of effort. I mean when I look back at moments that I could call out, you know certainly when starting the company, I&#8217;m not sure if this is a moment so much as a story you know sort of a narrative about, I think why we were able to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve always emphasised that the trick to, I think, 10up&#8217;s success is that I did not descend out of the sky one day out of college and say I&#8217;m a business owner. Before I started 10up I spent over a decade working for other people, doing side consulting. There was a whole story before 10up started which was time in the industry, building connections, building a network, investing in relationships, learning from mentors about how to think about a budget, and a P and L, and what&#8217;s really involved in hiring people. Having the joy of hiring someone great and the torture of having to let people go before I ever started the company. Knowing how to put numbers together, had fantastic mentors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want the honest answer, the real story of our success is, it was everything that happened before starting 10up. It was the relationships I was able to bring into that company, clients like side consulting projects I had been doing on the side for over a decade that I was able to bring in to the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot of people today that sort of drop out of the sky and say you know my role in life is to be an entrepreneur and day one I&#8217;m starting a company and I just, I can&#8217;t imagine I would have been nearly as successful, 10up would have been nearly as successful as it was if I didn&#8217;t have that whole backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can point to some other moments, you know winning in the first year. Getting introductions vis-à-vis those connections to customers like TechCrunch that we still work with to this day, on their site that have obviously become very powerful items in your portfolio. I can point to bringing on strong leaders including our CEO who joined us in 2014, still with us today, John Eckman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think one other thing that has made 10up different than some companies in the space is I like to believe it is not a company that revolves around its founder&#8217;s ego. That I&#8217;ve always tried to build it with a mindset of, I want this thing to be much more than Jake Goldman. I want the brand to be 10up not Jake&#8217;s company. I could ramble on but I think, that&#8217;s probably what I would leave you with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well thank you. The thing that we&#8217;re going to talk about from now is the joining of forces between 10up and a company which in the WordPress space maybe people haven&#8217;t heard about, and that is Fueled. We&#8217;ll talk about a piece which went on the 10up blog, I will link to it in the show notes. It&#8217;s called Fueled Up, 10up joins forces with Fueled Digital Media. And so that&#8217;s the direction of travel for the majority of the rest of the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m just wondering, in that journey, was the endeavor always growth? Grow, grow, grow, make the agency bigger. And if that was the case, what kind of changed your, direction? Because it seems like you had a bit of an epiphany earlier in the year of 2023. The article paints a picture that you were working with Fueled and then just have this sudden realisation, actually do you know what they are like us. They do something different but their alignment, the sort of direction of travel, their ethics, and all of that seems to match very well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then all of a sudden, well I say sudden, probably months and months in the making, you announced that you&#8217;ve joined forces. So I just wonder, what changed about the company that suddenly made you think let&#8217;s do something different, let&#8217;s join with some other company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:55] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> It&#8217;s a fantastic question and the reality is, I&#8217;ve written about this a little bit online, like my prior story. It was not a wake up one morning, my you know light bulb went off and the next day we closed the transaction kind of a thing. The reality is, I think we have to go all the way back to saying like, per my last remarks, I have always seen 10up as something that is, I want it to be much more than Jake Goldman Inc. That was always my vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think of me as an engineer at heart, I always sort of believe like the best thing you engineer is a thing that continues to live on and be used well beyond the time you spend on it, well beyond your focus on that project. And I&#8217;ve always felt the same way about a company, like the perfect business, the ideal company, the ideal team that you build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a world where you can someday step back and not be worried if I&#8217;m not in the room that this thing doesn&#8217;t keep succeeding, this team doesn&#8217;t keep thriving. That&#8217;s always been on my mind. It was on my mind when I think I surprised a lot of people, again, going all the way back to 2014, and hired a CEO that was not me into the company to help us build it. It&#8217;s always been on my mind as I built out different divisions and empowered strong leaders within the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there was a moment for me in the, you know the first few years of the 2020s, to me sort of peaking in 2022. Not sure intentionally but probably not accidentally after probably two or three of the most difficult and challenging years to be a business leader probably weighing on my mind as well. Any business leader who does not tell you there was a certain fatigue in 2020, 2021, 2022 is probably not being honest with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, more consciously I just felt like look, we&#8217;re about to break through $40 million in revenue, we think by the end of this year. We think we&#8217;re on a trajectory for 300 people at this company. I have been the overwhelming owner of the business, decision maker for you know, at that point for I guess 11 and a half years. And really felt like as we move forward this company needs to have more governance, a different kind of structure, a different kind of ownership that can A, help keep propelling it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve never run a company of that scale in size before. I think some of what you have to do to manage and invest in a company of that scale is a little bit different when you start to reach that kind of size. And I frankly want to make sure this company is taken care of in the event that I ever, you know I could get sick, I could get hit by a bus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think the company even as it existed previously, would suddenly just disappear overnight by any means. But there was a certain amount of like legal structure, a certain amount of like ownership management, and share structure. A certain amount of where are the other highly experienced, growing companies of this size kind of leaders and investors that were missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I thought about I can go through the effort to do that on my own, think about like employee owned companies or think about how to completely restructure stock and legal formations. To be honest with you, when I started thinking about that, I was struggling to imagine being excited to get out of bed for the next two years focused on like legal apparatus, and being that different kind of owner of that larger company which just. You know so I guess I&#8217;m rambling a little bit to say like that mindset that I was in of I think we need something more in terms of governance, ownership, to a degree, diluting the degree to which it sort of sits on my lap as an owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine that with my sense that the next phase of growth is, I think, going to come from moving even further up market to being even more of a serious competitor to like the Deloitte Digitals and the Code and Theory&#8217;s of the world, the people that are not coming in saying you know we&#8217;re great WordPress integrators, or just great website makers but were true full digital experience shops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think those things kind of collided for me in a way that said maybe it&#8217;s time to look at M&amp;A. Maybe it&#8217;s time to look at who we can join forces with. And I&#8217;ll be transparent, we went on a very intentional journey, we had advisors in that process. It was you know help guide me through an exploration of you know who might be the kind of company that you can join forces with. And let&#8217;s not just wait for it to fall in my lap, or just go on this blind exercise and all the you know, all my copious spare time of hunting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But be intentional about seeking who those partners would be. Spoke to a lot of different companies, had different sort of, I would say suitors, or even offers of which we walked away from. But as we got to know Fueled in particular and then started to do some projects together, and started to understand each other, it felt very clear to me that this was a unique and special fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay so let&#8217;s talk a little bit about Fueled. So I&#8217;m curious to know, what is it about them that make that fit special? So presumably you went out and I&#8217;m obviously going to paraphrase the whole process, but there must&#8217;ve been a series of check boxes that needed to be checked. The company needs to behave in this way, it needs to have this, it needs to have this, we need to be going in this direction, whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just wondering, why was it Fueled as opposed to all the other companies? And you can take that in whichever direction you like. It may have just been personnel, it may have been turnover, it may have been, I don&#8217;t know attitude, roster, anything you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:16] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> Yeah it&#8217;s definitely not just a one thing, but I have to say a lot of it sounds very non business like in a sense. But a lot of it was ineffable. A lot of it was just when you go and you meet with these different suitors, or these different potential partners, or companies that you could merge with. And you sit down in the room with them or you have, you know you start with the Zoom chat. I find myself sort of imagining okay, I&#8217;m in a boardroom in a hard time or a good time with them, a year from now, two years from now, how does that feel to me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a sort of cultural, does this feel natural? Does this feel like somebody that if I had to have hard conversations it wouldn&#8217;t be stilted, and more painful than it needs to be? Do I feel like I would be energised and sort of like an extroverted kind of way, like walk out of meetings and planning sessions more excited about what we&#8217;re doing, or would I feel a bit tired from that exercise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m trying to think how else to express it. It was just like when I sat down with them, when I met with them, when we actually worked on projects together and collaborated. It felt like if I had brought these people to, you know, if I just brought them to my team and said I just hired this person as a new key executive, or a new key director, or leader, everybody would have just said like you know great hire Jake, what an amazing fit for our culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that was extraordinarily important to me. Yes, there were other boxes to check. The financial side of everything had to make sense. The legal apparatus had to make sense. They had to be in a, obviously, you know reasonably healthy condition as a business. There were things I did not want in terms of like kind of companies that I thought could like destroy what&#8217;s precious about 10up and its culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could talk about all of those things, but at the end of the day when sort of settling down on that gut feeling of, is this a company that I want to be with, that I want to work with, that I want to join forces with? It was the checking of the boxes, different kind of skills, different kind of capabilities, all of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the end of the day, a lot of it came down to these are good people that I would enjoy working with. I would look forward to going to a board meeting. I would look forward to going to an exec planning session. They will make me a better leader. They will make my team better. My team will enjoy collaborating with these people in ways that you know going through this journey and talking to so many companies, even before 2020 like we&#8217;ve been approached before, and we&#8217;ve had conversations with different companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You start to realise how precious that match is. We can all sort of like be in our bubbles. But really when you start to talk to a lot of these different companies and agencies, you really realise pretty quickly that there are a lot of companies, a lot of people who are doing fantastic work, impressive businesses, but just very different kind of mindsets, cultures, communication styles, ways of thinking about the world. So when you find someone that you actually go and sit down in the meeting and it&#8217;s like I could hire you, I wish we could do more projects together, that&#8217;s something you latch on to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah what a great answer. I really enjoyed listening to that. The next thing I want to talk about is, how Fueled overlaps with you? So I&#8217;m imagining in my head a Venn diagram of two circles. And in the past, in the WordPress space, we&#8217;ve often seen one agency, for want of a better word, consume another agency. And it almost feels like the two circles are now completely overlapping. One is inside the other. So you can no longer see two circles. You just see one slightly bigger circle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it does seem as if with Fueled we&#8217;ve got a nicely fitting Venn diagram. There&#8217;s Fueled over here, there&#8217;s 10up over here, and there&#8217;s some elements of overlap but it&#8217;s not entire. The two circles are not colliding. And I&#8217;m just wondering, what it is that they do? What it is that you do? What&#8217;s the differentiators, and what is that lovely sweet spot in the middle where you both overlap?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:23] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> So I&#8217;ll start with the sweet spot in the middle. The sweet spot in the middle, to be a little highfalutin about it for a second, is like the desire to use technology, to use cutting edge innovative tech to create fantastic experiences for clients in an agency setting. It really is in some sense that crisp and that simple. We are a professional services business. We use online technologies to make great experiences for our customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now to be a little less flippant and a little bit more specific about it, like where we have skill set overlap. Fundamentals of doing design systems, whether it&#8217;s on mobile for a product, whether it&#8217;s on a website. Those are not fundamentally different like technical skill sets that you use every single day. There is an overlap and some like you know Next.js, React kind of front end technologies. They do some web applications in addition to mobile. In fact probably a growing part of their business relatively speaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you get beyond the sort of like core common technologies and practices you use when you&#8217;re a creative agency, and expand out to okay, what do we actually work on day to day? There is a healthy, non overlapping parts of the circles, outside parts of the Venn circles. Which is to say like I would say that they are predominantly focused on what they are good at, what they are known for, what they have repute in, is doing product development in the sense of mobile applications. Some web applications, but not marketing websites and publishing websites. Not CMS driven experiences really. Like applications, you know e commerce kind of functionality. Think of some of the projects they work on where it&#8217;s really you know shopping and user intention driven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10up is more on the website marketing, web publishing, web content creation. Again, we overlap a little bit, we&#8217;ve even done mobile apps in the past, but we are really strong in how to make a great website that can be put in the hands of those site owners, those site publishers with a strong content management system implementation behind it. And a major focus on content together. That&#8217;s media and publishing, or corporate newsrooms, or you know content marketing, or just flat out marketing websites and informational websites. When that was not something conversely that Fueled had really focused on or was good at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we both sort of you know looked at those two sides of the Venn diagram and sort of said, I bet we have a bunch of customers who could use the others services. And there&#8217;s a bunch of customers out there who don&#8217;t want a shop that sort of neatly fits in one bucket and is kind of stretching and reaching to have a compelling story about the other side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I don&#8217;t know exactly what the audience demographic is, but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be a lot of people who don&#8217;t work in enterprise agency land. And so this conversation is really interesting, and I am wondering if you&#8217;ve had to, probably this is the wrong word, but turn down work, or move away from work, or pivot away from work that, you simply as 10up, didn&#8217;t feel you would be doing the best job with. But now you feel, okay we can push forward with projects such as this in the future, because now it&#8217;s this bigger enterprise, it&#8217;s Fueled, it&#8217;s 10up, it&#8217;s whatever that&#8217;s going to be called in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:06] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> Oh yeah for certain. I mean literally can think of projects over the last few years where we had great enterprise, large scale, huge spending customers who needed, just to say it plainly, in some cases needed a mobile application built, put out RFPs for that and probably would have, hoping I&#8217;m not being hubristic here, probably would have loved to work with us, at least would have taken very seriously a submission from 10up. Where we just felt like we would not meet qualifications, we&#8217;re not confident that we could do a good job, in a way that would not diminish our entire relationship with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the more common scenario that I think about is where we are given opportunities to pitch business, we&#8217;re given opportunity, we have an introduction, we have a connection, and we just don&#8217;t quite compete in the right way in terms of coming across as having a real platform that you would describe as a full digital experience solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s true that we have customers, we have business that I would say has been left on the table because we didn&#8217;t have these capabilities. What I&#8217;m more focused on is where do we not compete well for opportunities? Where do we not get invited into the room or just not last long in the conversation? Because to overstate melodramatically for a fact, we come across as a WordPress integrator implementation shop, not a full digital experience business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s a third circle in this Venn diagram which we haven&#8217;t mentioned so far and it&#8217;s a venture capital company called Insignia Capital. I confess I don&#8217;t know anything about Insignia Capital. So I&#8217;m just wondering, probably fairly quickly, I don&#8217;t know if you want to dwell on this, but I&#8217;m just wondering if you could explain how that fits in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:29] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> Sure. So at the risk of splitting hairs for your audience they&#8217;re a private equity company which is a little bit different from venture capital. Probably not a very material difference for most of the people listening to this but it&#8217;s a little bit different. Sort of like, what are the returns they expect? How do they operate? Where do they get their funding? And so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still the same principle in terms of, I guess the short version would be that they are the money people. So the way that they fit, to try to make it concise, they joined forces with, made a massive investment in Fueled about one year ago. Which is to say they&#8217;re not the full ownership of Fueled. Fueled&#8217;s owners still hold a large share of that company, but they have controlling ownership, vis a vis putting a huge investment into Fueled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what Fueled, other than of course some opportunities for some liquidity for their owners wanted out of that, is a real partner who knows how to, from the investor side, has both connections, has both capital, has sort of financial and industry sophistication to help them build a bigger business together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to put it in plain terms, what Insignia wants to do is work with a platform, which for them that was Fueled as the initial partnership, the initial investment. To build a bigger, more valuable company that increases the value of the equity that they have in that business. The way that they do that oftentimes, like the strategy in professional and digital services is you do what&#8217;s called add ons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you bring in other companies into the fold, you attach them to that company and you end up with something that is much more valuable for a number of reasons. It&#8217;s higher revenue, but it&#8217;s also everything I just described about you have a you know, a shop that looks like a full digital services provider with CRM capability and sales force and CMS and mobile apps, is just a more valuable business than one that&#8217;s kind of pigeonholed in one of those spots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can kind of make smart investments with investors that really raise the overall value of the business. Like 10up, I would say Fueled&#8217;s ownership really did not have the sort of the sophistication, appetite, capital to do that on their own. Which is why they partnered up with Insignia. Insignia has sort of the financial vehicle, all those things I described earlier in the conversation, where it&#8217;s what does it mean to restructure legally 10up to have multiple ownership, and to have shares and to have stock and to have investors with a lot of influence and connections in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So long story short, they help us restructure to be able to join with Fueled, to be able to make one business out of these two companies. And that happens, in large part, by helping purchase a significant amount of 10up equity, so I am no longer the dominant controlling owner of 10up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a little muddy, and I guess like the short version of it is like they are the financial backers for this combined entity. They make it possible to restructure the business and combine into one through capital, and they also bring quite a bit of sophistication around how to build these platforms. They have connections with other companies that can be acquired, they have a lot of connections with very senior, influential people in the decision making space, in the agency space and in the B2B space. So it&#8217;s not that they just bring money, they also bring a lot of wisdom about how to build these larger companies as investors, advisors, board members with strong connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now that the ink is dry on the contracts and you&#8217;ve had a little bit of water flowing under the bridge, I&#8217;m just wondering if you can tell us how 10up particularly has changed? I know that your company is broadly distributed, and I just wondered, what is it that it&#8217;s going to look like if we can cast our eyes forward a year into the future? What are you endeavoring to create there? Is the idea that this one entity, everybody will be mixed? It will be a homogenous entity or will we have, broadly speaking, will we still have the WordPress side? What are you planning?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:42] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> So the first thing to say is when we get like sort of in the weeds of how it&#8217;s going to operate, and a question of like what has changed today. So far that is still a journey of discovery that we are on. That&#8217;s not BS, that is authentic. I can speak to what we all sort of I think share as like a heading and vision and ultimate destination, when you talk about the one, two, three years out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we don&#8217;t think that means like jumping in and month one, this is not like shifting around 17 different divisions and immediately restructuring in three months. No, we are learning from each other, we are still deep in the process of teams and project management, and design, and growth, and sales, and engineering. Sort of comparing notes, getting to understand each other better, getting more insight into each other&#8217;s businesses. Sharing leads, sharing opportunities that we think might be better fit to one team or the other. Sometimes sharing personnel where they&#8217;re skillsets overlap and one team or the other could use help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But really operating essentially as two, continuing to operate as we did before the merger, as two strong partners with a bunch of research, discovery, integration, exploration going on in the background of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of where we are headed. Yes, our goal is ultimately not to be like there&#8217;s a 10up and there&#8217;s a Fueled out there competing in the agency space, and sometimes sharing opportunities. Our ultimate goal is to be a unified business, to have a clear, centralised governance. To be able to go to market as one entity, one brand and sell a story of not two different partners working together, but one fully integrated set of capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now what that looks like again, there&#8217;s a lot to color in there that I just don&#8217;t have the answer for. I don&#8217;t even know that I have an answer, a definitive answer today for where like the brand question would even land. We might find ourselves in 12 months in a model that is still fairly divisional. Which is to say maybe more centralised leadership, centralised operations, more marketing and business development consolidation, but could still sort of like operate with divisions within the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One more focused on applications. One more focused on web and CMS. Could end up with some teams that are totally cross functional. The honest to god answer is that is what we are exploring and trying to work on with our teams and find the best path today. Better right than quickly is our point of view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of the roster that you&#8217;ve currently got. Now you mentioned TechCrunch, and we know that there&#8217;s a whole bunch of other enormous companies that you&#8217;ve worked with. Did you feel compelled to go out and communicate with them prior to heading down the direction of merging with Fueled? Was there any intuition that maybe your clients would be interested to know that information or potentially you know, nervous to hear that you were doing this, and how would it affect their incredibly important property?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:00] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> In a spiritual sense we did not have a lot of concern about it. We thought it would make sense. This is not a case of say it rather crassly like being gobbled up by some international conglomerate that might be controversial to some customers. This was not a case of like changing to foreign ownership of a business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was hard to see how any customers would be anything but sort of happy to hear that we have maybe more sophistication as an entity and a governance and ownership model than, one guy in California owning the business. And pleased to hear that we were expanding our capabilities and could offer more solution and more services to them in the future. So we didn&#8217;t really have any sense that like somebody was going to be very upset to hear about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a process, there is a certain amount of like notifying, interviewing a small number of customers beforehand that are seen as, maybe riskier because they have strong terms in their contracts around change of ownership. Or just large clients where you know nobody&#8217;s going to be happy if for some shocking reason it changed the game afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So were some that were informed and brought into the loop, not because we had deep existential concern about it, but because it was a part of a due diligence process. We did speak to a few customers but otherwise the process was largely once we knew this was closing, once we knew this deal was going to get done, it was a rapid notification process. A harried two or three weeks right after the deal closed to make sure that we had a very orderly structure. But a quick way, inform those clients, let them know what that meant for them, deal with any contract language implications or updates. And I have to say I think that went exceptionally smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just touching on WordPress, this is after all a WordPress podcast. You have mentioned that your team over the years has contributed really quite large amounts of time and effort and resources to the WordPress project itself. And so I&#8217;m just curious as to whether this has changed anything. Or whether you are still everything pointing towards WordPress going to be contributing in the same way. Still using that as the platform of choice for the web side of things, if nothing else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:50] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> So in terms of contribution nothing has changed. My hope is that this will open up added opportunities to contribute, make impact in the space. I think all of our new partners, Fueled, Insignia, understand that you know endemic to our strategy, our culture, our core values is that level of contribution that we make to the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is, you know even if you don&#8217;t believe in it from an ethical sense, from a business sense it has made sense for us and it has helped us grow and it&#8217;s helped us acquire business, and helped us have impact, and build culture. So you know there are no plans to change that level of investment that we make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of WordPress as a CMS platform, yeah, I mean at the end of the day Fueled and Insignia fully understood that that is our preferred CMS platform, that is the dominant platform that we use. Fully understood that, you know making a bet on 10up was also making a bet on WordPress continuing to be healthy and grow as a platform. The CEO, a lovely fellow named Rameet literally spoke to Matt Mullenweg, as I understand, before I even knew he did about WordPress and about 10up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day they are looking, you know they chose to merge with us and are looking for us to be the experts in CMS implementation and looking for us to be the experts in how to make these websites and experiences. They don&#8217;t have a hubris to think they&#8217;re going to come in and tell us, we wanted to merge with you but we think you&#8217;ve been doing it wrong the whole time, and you need to change platforms, right? That&#8217;s almost silly as a way of thinking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short answer is I mean yes, they very much understand what they were buying. They see us as the experts. They look up for us to continue guiding and we continue to see WordPress as our dominant platform that we work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I hope you don&#8217;t mind me asking you some personal question. I&#8217;m just wondering how this is going to affect you? You may decline to answer this question if you wish, and we can just cut it out entirely. But I&#8217;m just curious. From a lot of what you said there did seem to be some little bits of, you were intimating that some of these things were going to be wonderful for you as well as the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering if you&#8217;ve had any of those experiences? Has work become more pleasurable? Have you managed to get out of this what you want? Have you managed to make new friendships and new alliances? Is it everything you hoped it would be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:46] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> That&#8217;s a big question. I mean there&#8217;s two ways to answer that. I think there&#8217;s, I&#8217;m not trying to dodge, I think there&#8217;s a couple of different, two different ways of looking at that question. So the biggest sort of like aspiration that I wanted out of this, which is new partners, having people that are more my equals or even my seniors in this combined business. New advisors, new people that take true, you know in addition to some people on our team, new people, new additions to the team that take real, literal ownership of the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that is the case and it is welcome for me to have that, those kind of additions. I adore many of my new peers, feel energised when I work with them, when we sit down and plot out the future and work together. All of that is true. Now I think in the moment, four weeks in would I say that my life is now flowers and roses and better and easier? Let&#8217;s be earnest here. There&#8217;s two things going on at the moment. One is I had the same full time job that I had the week before, with a little less heavy as the head that wears the crown going on. But the same job that I had the month before in terms of like, again, we didn&#8217;t snap our fingers and transform the business operations overnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I also have this additional responsibility, which I take very seriously of that, playing a key role in facilitating change management and a longer term integration strategy. So if I was being very honest at the moment, my feeling is delight with the partners that we&#8217;ve chosen. A little bit of overwhelm and fatigue on like how much more there is to do at the moment. The seriousness with which I take this whole process is not a light burden. Doing big change management across a team of our scale is not a light duty for lack of a better word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This question would be best answered in a year&#8217;s time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:15] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> A hundred percent it would.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s put that topic behind us and just get onto a subject which is completely nothing to do with what we&#8217;ve been talking about. Just for a few moments. I&#8217;m interested because AI is all the rage, if we were to rewind the clock two years, just two years, I don&#8217;t think anybody really in the WordPress space was really talking about AI. Maybe tangentially or some aspirational talk about what it could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now fast forward to today. We&#8217;ve just had a year of utterly seismic change in the capabilities of what AI can do. Most of it disconnected completely with website building. So we&#8217;ve got OpenAI and Anthropic and a bunch of other companies launching really seismically amazing products. And I&#8217;m just wondering what your thoughts are? What your intuitions are about where this is going to land with website building, with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I know that&#8217;s an incredibly broad question but I feel that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got at the moment because we don&#8217;t have concrete things to pin our discussion to. So I&#8217;m just wondering what your general thoughts are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:16] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> Great question. Hang on one second while I type that question into ChatGPT. So we have lots of thoughts and lots of initiatives going on there. I think the first one to call out, and this is a bit of a plug, we have an extension we&#8217;ve been working on since before this was cool, since 2018. Back when we called this machine learning more often than artificial intelligence, called Classifai, that&#8217;s C L A S S I F A I, because we&#8217;re too clever with our puns. So ClassifaiPlugin.com, or just look up Classifai or 10up and AI, it&#8217;ll probably come up. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll put it in show notes or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That plugin has been an experiment staging ground with us for, again, going back to 2018. It is not focused on like how to, I&#8217;m not sure I buy that this is the right use case for our kind of customers or you know the dominant part of the market. It does not try to be one of these like, we&#8217;re going to build your whole website for you. We&#8217;re going to write your story for you and your content. And those are cool demos, there are probably some very small business kind of use cases where you just need kind of like a boilerplate, you know you need to have the brochure. That just has to be a checkbox put next to we have a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the kind of market we work with I don&#8217;t think those are more than frankly sort of novelty demos at this point in time. That might change as the technology gets better in a year or two, but I don&#8217;t think a serious marketer is saying I&#8217;m going to write my pages and do my layouts just using AI on its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we do think is that AI integrated with WordPress, which is what Classifai aims to do, can be extraordinarily powerful in simplifying repetitive tasks, and being an assistant and support to people that are creating and publishing content. So it does things like integrate natively with image generation services. If you want to generate a photo for your site, it will do things like create alt tags, and text descriptions for images, smart crop. It&#8217;ll take a pass at making paragraphs shorter or longer, individually in form on your site. It&#8217;ll tag images so you can navigate your media library better. It&#8217;ll suggest alternative titles you might want to consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are very focused in Classifai on what we would describe as extremely pragmatic, realistic, not novelty demo, kind of integration so that WordPress can compete. You know it&#8217;s completely open source, free plugin. You have to pay sometimes for the third party services, like the image generation services are mostly licensed. But we don&#8217;t make anything off of that, you just buy those services and plug your keys into Classifai settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this very pragmatic setup where we think that customers, we hope other people using WordPress, can look to Classifai to be a very sort of modern, sort of high end, prosumer enterprise solution that gives an answer to, how do you use WordPress and AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the technology, engineering side we have a working group. We have ongoing exploration of how do we in a safe way, in a private way, that respects our customers but in a way that keeps us competitive, continues to make sure that we don&#8217;t fall behind or suddenly become just wildly out of league and what it costs us to make something. Is experimenting with things like GitHub Copilot and more structured ways we can use that across projects. Experimenting with things like code generation with chat GPT. I don&#8217;t think the kind of websites we make are going to be like, build a whole website or 80 percent of the code with those tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see it as an accelerant, no different than like when we had IDEs or even when we shifted from writing machine code to more natural languages like C and C++ and Swift and all the rest. And I think it&#8217;s still early in that exploration. There are certainly signals that there are some kinds of tasks, certain migration tasks, certain repetitive scripting tasks in the shell that you can automate, that you can accelerate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our job right now, and that job&#8217;s not done, is to figure out when you have a scale of you know 300 people and 100 or 200 some engineers. How do you create a standard? How do you create a process? What does it mean to create an expectation? Not across one or two people who are smart, curious and hungry to use these, but across an entire team to stay competitive and stay ahead of the curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I could bring you all the answers other than to say like I think that technology will keep getting better. I do think it will help. I am not in the camp of at least for the next you know sort of five years. I am not in the camp of, this is going to replace the need for engineers. You know there are certain leaders in the WordPress space who I think would say like they imagine a few years from now their engineering teams go down from like a hundred to like five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll eat these words. I think it&#8217;s a bit silly when we think about the next two, three, four, even five years. I think it&#8217;s more like an extreme version of the leap again to like things that would have seemed very foreign 40 years ago, 50 years ago when the industry was frankly smaller, not larger. Where we started to have tools you know template patterns like you know the internet and access to Stack Overflow and good code completion tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These accelerant tools did not obliterate the industry, right? The industry is larger than it&#8217;s ever been. Which is to say like a rapid, rapid, huge changes that make engineering and technical tasks easier has never in the history of tech and computing and the web made for a smaller industry. It has always made a larger industry. It just gives people more time to think, to be creative, to make things that are more advanced. It&#8217;s raised the bar higher on what people expect in terms of quality and completeness of the experiences they get. I think that is more the world that we live in for the next three, four, five years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m just wondering if there is some little part of AI which you&#8217;ve looked at, and again you know if this encroaches on business processes and things like that, you need not divulge what it is. I just wondered if at the level that you&#8217;re working at, if there are certain aspects of AI which you&#8217;re thinking, boy that really would save us a lot of time. That really does look like something which we should invest. It sounded like everything that you were developing, the Classifai is for the end user broadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It enables people like me to do my work quicker. But I&#8217;m just wondering if there was something that you were curious about on the AI side which would make your business processes quicker. And again, feel free to not divulge if you don&#8217;t wish to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:36] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> I mean the short answer is yes, I think there is. I&#8217;m not not divulging anything to say like I&#8217;m not sure in a sustainable way what those things are yet. I know what we&#8217;re experimenting with. I know what we see some promise in. I kind of take the longer view and feel like it&#8217;s not clear yet which of these are sort of novelties in their appeal. Which of these are have enduring power as change forces in our process. It still feels like we&#8217;re in a little bit of a, I think, still in the getting to know it phase. I do think there are some things around like more baseline tasks in an estimate, or when we&#8217;re building certain kind of projects or certain kind of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My suspicion is some migration work, some sort of like more fundamental lower level like set up, the v1 of just setting up a basic added functionality. That will go faster, that will be accelerated. But I have to just be honest. I&#8217;m still not even confident enough that we&#8217;ve done that enough times, tried that enough times, to know whether this is more like when GitHub comes along, becomes popular whether it totally changes the way we work, or it&#8217;s just another tool that helps people be more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> My intuitions are that anybody that puts their flag in the sand and says AI will enable this is probably setting themselves up for having to admit that they were wrong. Almost everything that I&#8217;ve predicted has not come to pass. Yeah we just have to be, roll with the punches, be flexible I suppose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jake it&#8217;s been lovely chatting to you today about all of this. I wonder if you make yourself available elsewhere online. Whether or not you want to divulge a social handle that you use, or a good place where people can contact you. Having listened to this there may be people who wish to do that, and if you wish to spread the word about that please do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:14] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> Here&#8217;s a phrase I never thought I would say five years ago. So the place to most get my insight and hear what I&#8217;m thinking about business and 10up is LinkedIn. So if you just search for Jake Goldman on LinkedIn I should pop right up, or Jake Goldman in WordPress. That&#8217;s probably the best place to go. I mean go to 10up.com and follow our blog. I mean again all of our business activity as a company is there. In terms of like personal posting, not terribly active on any social media at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well thank you Jake for chatting to me on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:40] <strong>Jake Goldman:</strong> Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobgoldman/\">Jake Goldman</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jake is the President &amp; Founder of 10up, a digital agency that builds websites and tools for content creators, leveraging open platforms like WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start the conversation with an exploration of the recent merger with 10up, Fueled and Insignia. For many years, 10up has been one of the leading Enterprise WordPress agencies. With a roster of well-known clients, Jake has grown the company from himself to hundreds of employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst this journey has been exciting and challenging, Jake talks about some areas in which 10up has not been able to compete and how the merger with Fueled will enable them to position themselves for projects which used to be out of reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fueled brings their experience of crafting mobile experiences, and Insignia brings their financial expertise, as well as the industry connections they have built up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jake shares how this new venture will continue to leverage WordPress as their CMS of choice; these new partners understand and support 10up’s commitment to contributing to WordPress. There are no plans to immediately alter the structures of either 10up or Fueled, It’s more about building an understanding of the capabilities of each partner, working towards a future in which the company grows into one entity over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the intentional pursuit of potential partners, and Jake reflects on the importance of cultural alignment and connections. He shares how his prior experience has shaped both his personal journey as a leader and the success of 10up, and we explore the milestones, challenges, and key moments that have brought them to where they are today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we pivot to talk about the role of AI in the future of WordPress. It’s clear that AI is coming, and it’s coming rapidly. Any agency working with WordPress would find this topic hard to ignore. But what impact will it really have? Are we expecting entire websites to be built in seconds by just clicking a button? Jake expresses his view that these tools are to be seen as accelerants, complementing human website development rather than replacing it, particularly at the Enterprise level. We delve into 10up’s ongoing exploration and experimentation with AI, discussing some of the tools they have freely released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in how Enterprise agencies grow, or the future of AI with WordPress, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://10up.com/\">10up website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fueled.com/en-gb\">Fueled</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2023/10up-joins-forces-with-fueled-digital-media/\">Fueling Up: 10up joins forces with Fueled Digital&nbsp;Media</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\">Anthropic</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://classifaiplugin.com/\">ClassifAI plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobgoldman/\">Jake Goldman on LinkedIn</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Oct 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Automattic Acquires Texts, An All-in-One Messaging App\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=150606\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-texts-an-all-in-one-messaging-app\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2807:\"<p>Automattic has acquired <a href=\"https://texts.com/\">Texts</a>, an all-in-one messaging platform, for $50 million. Texts is a newer company founded in 2020 that creates a centralized inbox for all major messaging platforms, including iMessage, WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, Signal, Twitter, LinkedIn, Slack, and Discord. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proliferation of messaging apps and inboxes has made responding to communication more complicated than it was in previous years. Most companies would prefer to keep users on their own platforms, but Texts offers a new level of interoperability between messaging apps that doesn&#8217;t require the use of its own servers. The website states that users&#8217; messages never touch Texts&#8217; servers. They are encrypted and sent directly to the messaging platforms. Texts charges a monthly subscription, instead of making money by selling users&#8217; data. It also offers a number of AI-powered features for chat summaries, drafts, and translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic&#8217;s Texts acquisition <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/10/24/texts-joins-automattic/\">announcement</a> states that the company is moving &#8220;into a fourth market that’s integral to the modern web experience: messaging.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg has been eying the messaging market for years and has previously spoken of his fascination with messaging platforms and their relationship with the independent web. In an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P2qbSMdCvis\">interview with Om Malik</a> at WordCamp Europe 2017, he mentioned that Automattic was experimenting with Telegram’s group broadcasting feature. More recently, it 2020, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-invests-4-6m-in-new-vector-creators-of-the-matrix-open-standard-for-decentralized-communication\">Automattic invested $4.6M in New Vector</a>, a company founded by the creators of <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">Matrix</a>, an open standard that powers decentralized conversations with end-to-end encryption. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Texts&#8217; founder, Kishan Bagaria, will take on a new role as Head of Messaging at Automattic and the rest of the 10-person team was retained to continue working on the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to an inquiry about the status of the iOS and Android mobile apps for Texts, a representative from Automattic said the company is currently testing an iOS beta with a subset of users. Android support is on the roadmap. The representative also confirmed there are no plans to change pricing right now but Automattic is considering the addition of a freemium plan in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Texts will be expanding its coverage to streamline messages across more platforms. Matrix, Tumblr, and many more integrations are on the roadmap, including Snapchat, Google Messages, and Reddit.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Oct 2023 02:19:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: Texts Joins Automattic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=102049\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2023/10/texts-joins-automattic/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3203:\"<p><a href=\"https://texts.com/\">Texts is a fun application (desktop only for now) that brings all of your messages into one inbox</a>.

It is compatible with WordPress multisite, and popular plugins like WooCommerce, bbPress, and Yoast SEO, which may contribute to its popularity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence security researcher István Márton discovered the XSS vulnerability and responsibly disclosed it to the LiteSpeed Cache Team on August 14, 2023. The Wordfence <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2023/10/4-million-wordpress-sites-affected-by-stored-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-lightspeed-cache-plugin/\">advisory</a> describes how the vulnerability might make it possible for an attacker to inject malicious scripts:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘esi’ shortcode in versions up to, and including, 5.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Márton also cautioned that previous versions of WordPress contained a vulnerability that allowed shortcodes supplied by unauthenticated commenters to be rendered in certain configurations. All versions since WordPress 5.9 were subject to this vulnerability and if users aren&#8217;t on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/wordpress-6-2-2-security-release/\">a patched version of WordPress</a>, the vulnerability would &#8220;make it possible for unauthenticated attackers to exploit this Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability on vulnerable installations.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>LiteSpeed Cache patched the vulnerability in version 5.7, released to WordPress.org on October 10. Although the update has been available for two weeks, only 30% of the plugin&#8217;s user base is running the latest version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LiteSpeed Cache users are recommended to update to the latest patched version as soon as possible.

The theme made headlines earlier this month after <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/contentious-review-process-leads-ollie-theme-to-remove-innovative-onboarding-features-amid-stagnating-block-theme-adoption\">a contentious WordPress.org review process led its authors to remove the innovative onboarding features</a>. Ollie was approved for WordPress.org but without the time-saving onboarding features its authors initially hoped to include. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing the plugin, it is a night and day difference between having onboarding for a theme with so many patterns and options, versus getting dropped into a new theme with no direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2582\" height=\"1308\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-21-at-4.07.23-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150521\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of hunting around for various settings, the plugin helps users get everything set up with just a few clicks. It includes settings for the color palette, brand color, logo, and site icon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wizard also enables fast page creation where users can check a box for any of the full-page designs that they want to be created as pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2092\" height=\"1202\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-21-at-4.21.49-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150522\" />\n\n\n\n<p>One particularly time-saving screen on the onboarding wizard is the one with the homepage settings. Getting the homepage set can be a confusing part of setup for new WordPress users, especially if they don&#8217;t know where to look for the setting.  Ollie Dash allows a user to select the homepage from a dropdown before they even begin customizing the site. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2084\" height=\"1208\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-21-at-4.26.47-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150524\" />\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the onboarding wizard, users have the option to instantly create and activate a child theme. It&#8217;s not necessary for every website, but is a major time saver for those who intend to further customize the theme&#8217;s code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The onboarding includes docs and video resources for getting started, which can be loaded directly inside the wizard without leaving the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister said Ollie Dash will be the foundation for more features his team has in development. They are taking the plugin route as an opportunity to add more functionality than would generally be allowed in a WordPress.org-hosted theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister said he plans to make the plugin available on WordPress.org in the future. There are currently 1,062 plugins awaiting review in the queue today, with a wait time of 87 days for an initial review. In the meantime, Ollie Dash can be <a href=\"https://olliewp.com/download/\">downloaded</a> from the Ollie website and can also be found <a href=\"https://github.com/OllieWP/ollie-dash\">on GitHub</a>. Users will be notified in the dashboard when there is an update.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 21 Oct 2023 20:53:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 11.4.0-beta1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=331673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://buddypress.org/2023/10/buddypress-11-4-0-beta1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4588:\"<p>Hello community!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We usually build pre-releases for next BuddyPress major versions, this one&#8217;s goal is to make sure we can safely publish our next maintenance release (11.4.0).

This change may be a deliberate recognition of the majority (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">51.4%</a>) of WordPress users who run the software in a non-English language. WordPress adoption has the most potential for growth in emerging markets and locales where Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese languages are spoken. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, Mullenweg has used the State of the Word address to make important announcements, share progress, galvanize the contributor base, and recast the vision for WordPress. As the Gutenberg project is now into Phase 3 focusing on collaboration, I would not be surprised to see a demo of functionality that users can expect to see in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Live attendees will need to reserve a ticket for their seats at the in-person event. A live stream will be available for the vast majority of the WordPress world who will not be able to attend. As in previous SOTW events, anyone will be able to submit questions for the live Q&amp;A portion. The team managing the event plans to release more details in November.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Oct 2023 03:58:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: WordPress Relaunches Showcase Powered by Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=150376\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-showcase-powered-by-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4711:\"<p>WordPress.org has launched the redesign of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/\">Showcase</a>, with new block-based components, through a collaboration between the Design, Marketing, and Meta teams that began last year. It&#8217;s part of a larger effort to modernize WordPress.org and comes two months after the project relaunched a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/a-new-wordpress-org-homepage-and-download-page/\">new design for the WordPress.org homepage and Download page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> The updated Showcase allows visitors to browse via categories and tags and offers a significantly improved experience on mobile.  It included 101 sites at launch, which can be filtered by five categories: Business, Community, Creative, Publication, and Store, along with nearly half a dozen tags. Visitors can also select from three flavors: WordPress, WordPress Enterprise, and Multisite.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1432\" height=\"1196\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-18-at-11.08.40-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150379\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The featured listing at the top of the Showcase randomly updates on refresh.

It contains a diverse representation of some of the best WordPress-powered sites on the web, including the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/meta-newsroom/\">Meta Newsroom</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/harvard-university/\">Harvard University</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/nasa/\">NASA</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/rolling-stone/\">Rolling Stone</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/usain-bolt/\">Usain Bolt</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/the-white-house/\">The White House</a>, among many other high profile web properties. The showcase also includes some lesser known, beautifully designed sites, featuring art and creativity across a wide range of disciplines, highlighting the endless possibilities and versatility of the WordPress platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2402\" height=\"1088\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-19-at-6.22.19-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150435\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This new implementation of the showcase is powered by blocks, built on a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-showcase-2022\">custom child theme</a> for WordPress.org&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-parent-2021\">parent block theme</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This structure allows the site to take advantage of Core functionality like Group and Query blocks as well as custom blocks explicitly built for WordPress.org,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored WordPress core contributor Nick Diego said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Showcase also introduces new block-based functionality and several components that will be used elsewhere on the WordPress.org network. Improvements, such as the standardization of layout and spacing variables (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-parent-2021/issues/105\">#105</a>) and the new Query Filter block (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-mu-plugins/pull/441\">#441</a>), will make it easier to update other areas of WordPress.org to blocks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated showcase is an invaluable resource for agencies and freelancers who are building sites for clients and need to demonstrate the capabilities of WordPress to scale and serve any industry. It&#8217;s also still <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/\">open for new submissions</a>, which meet the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using WordPress in a unique or innovative way</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Representing a notable organization, government entity, or corporation as an official blog or website</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using modern WordPress</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are working to streamline and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-showcase-2022/issues/223\">automate</a> the submission process, although it will still include a manual review.  As this process improves, the showcase will become easier to maintain than it has been in previous years.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Oct 2023 23:15:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WordPress.org blog: State of the Word 2023 – Save the Date\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=16116\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/10/state-of-the-word-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1591:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/10/Web-SOTW-Image-1200x800-2.png?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"Madrid State of the Word 2023, Dec 11, 2023 at 15:00 UTC, Madrid, Spain\" class=\"wp-image-16208\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It’s time to save the date, December 11, 2023, for this year’s State of the Word!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State of the Word is the annual keynote address delivered by the WordPress project’s co-founder, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordPress 6.4 a little bit and Gutenberg 16.8, and then we also will talk about what&#8217;s already been worked outside the current releases. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source Project, sponsored by Automattic&#8217;s Five for the Future Program. Today, my co-host and special guest is Joni Halabi. She is not a stranger to the Gutenberg Times&#8217; subscribers. She&#8217;s a senior developer at Georgetown University and has been building blocks since forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our recent adventure together was the Gutenberg Life Q&amp;A with David Bowman and Alec Geatches, and a fascinating discussion about design systems and how WordPress slowly becomes one. Joni is also the author of a great article on the WordPress developer blog explaining the difference between a static and a dynamic block. A lot of people have read this, so you made an impact there definitely, Joni. It&#8217;s my great pleasure to have you on the show tonight, Joni. Welcome. How are you today?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: I&#8217;m doing great, thank you. I&#8217;m really excited to be on this show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome, awesome. Well, we can go right in there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first developer notes for 6.4 have been published on the Make blog, and one is for a new extensibility feature for the block editor. That&#8217;s about the block box. It&#8217;s only for dynamic blocks and it&#8217;s only the first iteration, though there are some, but it&#8217;s actually the first time that you can, as a developer, automatically insert a block next to another block. You can decide, okay, for every comment block, I want a like button in there. You create the like button block and then you say, &#8220;Okay, put it on every comment.&#8221; The user will be able to see that in the sidebar, but it will be automatically added, but a user can switch them on and off if they want to. So, that&#8217;s definitely for developers to dive in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi:</em> Yeah, I just wanted to say I am particularly excited about this feature. I just recently saw that this was being added, and it&#8217;s probably no secret that I am a very big advocate of dynamic blocks. So, many of the blocks that we&#8217;ve created over at Georgetown are dynamic, and I see so many use cases for that. I think it&#8217;s going to give our users a lot of flexibility. I think it&#8217;s going to give users overall across all WordPress sites, so much flexibility and different options. I can&#8217;t wait to see where this is going. I know that this is a first iteration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It still has some restrictions on there. Right now, it&#8217;s only working for template post types, template parts or patterns. So, it&#8217;s more usable for theme developers or those who want to change the front end a little bit and add it there. It&#8217;s a great feature to add a little shopping cart in the header of a template, shopping cart block. Yeah, there are quite a few other use cases. I could think about the like button going everywhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Oh, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Another use case could be to have a little anchor link on every paragraph, so you can share it everywhere and not have to share the full page, but just the paragraph thing if you want to cite it on a different blog post or something like that. Yeah, it would be helpful. I know a few bloggers actually do that in their self-built blog site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Do you see any other use cases off the top of your head?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Oh, goodness. Thinking about it, I think you gave some really, really great examples. Yeah, I definitely see a lot for e-commerce usage. Maybe even have a related products block going along that e-commerce theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a good one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, I think people can get really creative with this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think so too. Yeah, so check it out. We will have the link in the show note and with all the stuff in there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the editor components updates, that&#8217;s a roundup post of all the different changes in the component&#8217;s package of the editor. It has nothing to do with the WordPress components, which are totally different. There are 60 of those, but that&#8217;s different. So, it talks about the new props for the modal component, making a popup slot available in the sidebar, rewriting tooltip and tab panel to use a better accessibility library for that, improving size consistency, all different.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the few off the top of my head or top of the list of those. Then there is a very nice new feature, it&#8217;s called the registerInserterMediaCategory API and Nick Tsekouras published that about a new hook or API. Yeah, depends on what it is, how you would say it. That is that you can add another category in the inserter for the image block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: I love categorization. I think this is going to really enable people to better organize their media or organize their images. I don&#8217;t know too much about this, but this one looks like a very, very useful one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It definitely comes with an example code that actually adds a new open verse category to it, but it limits the search to exclude some sources. It&#8217;s just an example of that when people search in the open source category, open verse category. But other than that, there are some great comments in the example code and check it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the next one that I wanted to mention is WordPress Core, and both Gutenberg and Core now are using Playwright for all browser-based unit tests. There had been a great effort to rewrite many of the unit tests to Playwright and downsize the Puppeteer exposure of the code base.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not done yet, but it&#8217;s definitely progressing very fast. Playwright just has a few advantages over Puppeteer, and most of them have to do with the browser testing. So, visual regression testing is a little bit more stable for both the Core and the Gutenberg.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: The article on this, if anybody is interested, there&#8217;s a link to Playwright documentation. There is a link to migrating tests, so that&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s worth checking out. If you&#8217;re in that business of writing automated tests, then it looks like it&#8217;s going to be much more stable now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, but we still will see some flaky tests coming through the issue tracker, but I think it&#8217;s one of the oddities of the Gutenberg repo that you see flaky tests coming up and then they&#8217;re gone again because it has run through it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s also a new admin notice function in WordPress 6.0 and Colin Stewart wrote the death note for it with new functions get admin notice and then the parameters for it and the filters and the actions and example code for that and also how to create a collection of notices so they can be output at once.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;ll offset what many people see in the WordPress Admin. Right now, that is a page long admin notices for something, if that offsets that, but I think a lot of people were working on it for several years. So, I think that is really cool that it&#8217;s coming in now. Right now, I think it&#8217;s not mandatory to use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, I think it&#8217;s going to make it easier for plugin authors to create admin notices. So, for example, if your plugin is introducing a breaking change or if your plugin requires a database update, things like that, I see a lot of those notices come across.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no, it&#8217;s definitely raising the whole field for plugin extenders. So, this and many, many more. There are many more dev note, not many, but I would say six or seven additionally being worked on for the field guide of the release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just an update on WordPress 6.4, October 17th is the day of release candidate one and that&#8217;s also the deadline for the field guide. We all know if it weren&#8217;t for the last minute, nothing would get done. So, also, the death notes will come in at the last minute tomorrow to get into the field guide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People, if you haven&#8217;t tested your theme plugin or sites with a new release, now is the time. The final release is only three weeks away, and that&#8217;s only three weeks to fix things if something doesn&#8217;t work right. Not every plugin or theme developer is that. Best ones are of course updating their plugins and the themes ahead of time, but you definitely need to make sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi:</em> Yes, super, super important. Use that beta test or plugin and test, test, test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Test, test, test. I wanted to give a shout-out to a plugin called Site Health and Troubleshooting, because that plugin has saved my bacon many, many times when I was working with clients for our agency. It comes from Core developers and is a switch. Remember when you want to troubleshoot something and support says, &#8220;Did you disable all plugins and themes?&#8221; Yeah, how do you do that on a live site? It&#8217;s really hard and this plugin to the rescue, because you can as an admin switch off all plugins and themes at once without affecting the front end of your website. It&#8217;s really the best plugin testing tool ever. You get all the information from the Site Health features, and then you can enable each theme or plugin one at a time without affecting the front page. You see where the error comes in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within minutes, most of the time, you figure out which plugin is the culprit and then get connected with the plugin support of that plugin and to make it. So, Site Health and Troubleshooting, the troubleshooting part isn&#8217;t a plugin. Site Health is built into WordPress. So, if you run into trouble, especially site owners that have no technical knowledge whatsoever, it&#8217;s really hard to disable all the plugins without offsetting this live site. Who does that? But yeah, I did for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, and not everybody is lucky enough to have a staging site, for example. I had never heard of this plugin, but I&#8217;m writing that down. I&#8217;m going to check that out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Of course, there will be a link in the show notes for everyone to check it out and have a better life with updating any plugins as well as themes. Yeah, so that&#8217;s my spiel around 6.4. It was a short release cycle. There were only five Gutenberg plugin releases between 6.3 and 6.4. So, that&#8217;s only half of what other major WordPress releases had before. So, 6.2 had 10 and 6.3 had 10 too, 6.4 is only five. But also, we have very early in the year and I think over all the times when we do major plugin releases during Christmastime or holiday time. So, thank God for that, but that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s also not so many new features in the version.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, it did feel fairly light. I was surprised it was coming so quickly. But yeah, no, it has been about that time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 16.8</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Otherwise, if you do five more Gutenberg cycles, 16.8 was released at October 11. So, you would go right into the holiday time with your release, especially with the major part of the release, which is getting everything ready for beta and then getting every documentation death note written for release candidate one. So, I think this is a better way on clearing out the year, which brings us to what&#8217;s released in Gutenberg. Gutenberg 16.8 came out. Vicente Canales released it on October 11. There&#8217;s also a minor release, 16.8.1 available now, and it mainly contains its fixes and improvements that were necessary after WordPress 6.4 beta testing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the 160 PRs, still a big release. 49 were backport to the WordPress 6.4 beta releases. So, there are definitely additional bug fixes in that release. Of course, we have the show notes for the release post that Vicente published, but we go through the show notes. There is one new feature that I wanted to point out, and that is that when you edit pages in the site editor, it now has a template toggle to show the template. The site editors in 6.3 is now also the place where you can edit your content on pages or edit the page template and now you have a toggle in that. So, it&#8217;s easier and accessible. But yeah, I saw some of the feedback coming back from the call for testing that Anne McCarthy did with the site editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s still some really confusion in, &#8220;When are we editing content and when are we adding template?&#8221; There&#8217;s still something that confuses people, including people who do content editing every day and still get confused. Where am I now and what am I doing? So there&#8217;s still something to be had about that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, I can see that. There are a lot of things that we call editors within the scope of WordPress. So, I mean, there&#8217;s the editor, the site editor, the post editor. Editor is a loaded word. I think it&#8217;s really going to come down to the UI of all of these editing structures that we have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Then you have the person editor, the editor with the capabilities of editing stuff. So, we use the same word for a lot of things. It&#8217;s confusing and you always need to figure out the context in which you are talking about, but I saw in Gutenberg, there is actually the effort to streamline the post editor with the site editor and the widget editor and all that, the navigation editor. They&#8217;re all coming into the same iframe and have now almost all the same features with a sidebar, with a list view. So, I think that the efforts are really good to streamline those interfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, for sure. There&#8217;s so much going on right now and I&#8217;m really looking forward to that effort being completed because then I think that&#8217;s the point where we&#8217;re going to get to true full site editing where everything is just on the same screen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: That&#8217;s going to be a good day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. I&#8217;m never sure if we will ever get to the completion part. Well, this is a web. Yeah, you need to let it go. Yeah. There is no perfect though. There is no complete. It&#8217;s all in flux. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: It&#8217;s an evolution. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, what&#8217;s next?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: So the next, there are a number of updates in the block library, and the first one that I&#8217;d like to call out is one about the footnotes. So, the footnotes now using the Core&#8217;s meta revisioning, if it&#8217;s available, which footnotes in general is a very, very interesting new feature that I really want to start diving into. But yeah, this one is specifically in terms of making sure that those revisions stay in line with what&#8217;s going on with Core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The new feature, you&#8217;re thinking about footnotes or you&#8217;re thinking about meta revisions?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Oh, footnotes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: I&#8217;m very hard focused, but yeah, no, footnotes. I think footnotes are going to be really great, especially in terms of the blogging aspects of people&#8217;s sites. I have makeshift footnotes in the posts on my own site, so streamlining the ability to create footnotes like this is….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Especially with academic settings. Yeah, academic settings, yeah. It&#8217;s really important. Also, when you&#8217;re citing other third sources, you cannot always link from the&#8230; I think it&#8217;s easier to put it in footnotes for the reader than getting bogged down and following the link and missing the rest of the post when you link-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; in between. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, that and annotations too. I tend to write and I also want to annotate my work. I don&#8217;t want to necessarily lead my reader down the same rabbit hole that I am in when I&#8217;m writing the post, but if they want more information, yes, please go down to the footnotes. Take a look at this rabbit hole that I have created and then please go back to my main points.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, but footnotes are stored in post meta, but there has never been a revision feature for post metadata and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s that particular PR phrased that way. So, it uses the meta revision once available if it&#8217;s available, and there is a track ticket that the meta revisions actually are coming into 6.4. So, it&#8217;s what comes first kind of thing, but they figured it out in that. Yeah. So, the next part I wanted to point out is adding design tools to as many blocks as possible is on the way. The login, logout block now has spacing support, which is really helpful. So, you don&#8217;t have to use the spacer anymore. You can just do it through the block as well, block sidebar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yup, and then the next one is being able to set a custom color when applying an initial background image. So, I love anything that lets somebody set a custom color, because then you can really control the accessibility of that background color in case your image fails for whatever reason. You can default to that custom color and it maintains the accessibility of the page. So, if your text is white and you have a dark background image, for example, then for whatever reason you&#8217;re on a poor connection, for whatever reason, the image doesn&#8217;t load, you&#8217;re not stuck with a page that&#8217;s showing white text on top of a white background because nobody can read that. Being able to set that custom color to be that fallback for the image that hopefully loads but might not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think one of the features here is also that it&#8217;s actually automatically detecting the background of the image that you load and setting it automatically, so you don&#8217;t have to think about it, because I wouldn&#8217;t think about that accessibility piece unless somebody points it out to me. Oh yeah, you&#8217;re right. Yeah, I should have set a custom color, but doing it automatically I think is one of those great features that you don&#8217;t have to think about and it really supports accessibility without making a fuss about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Especially if it&#8217;s right on that cusp where if you are a fully cited user, you might be able to read that text and you might not realize, &#8220;Oh wait, this red text on a blue background, I can read it, but maybe somebody else can&#8217;t.&#8221; Yeah, I love automation like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, the next thing is default suggested links to pages. So, that&#8217;s in context of external links. So, that&#8217;s a very interesting diagram in the PR that makes me think, &#8220;Is that too complicated or is that very easy?&#8221; It&#8217;s mainly for the navigation block. When you have a third party link, it suggests that. What does it do?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: So what my takeaway from this was that I actually had a really hard time reading this diagram that&#8217;s in here, because there is a lot going on, but it seems like the suggestions that were originally coming up in the navigation lock were just everything, post pages, what have you. It seems that they are limiting that to only pages, instead of posts, which I think narrows the scope. I like this narrowing of the scope, because when you&#8217;re creating a navigation block, you&#8217;re more likely to want to link to a more evergreen page than to a post that might be fresh now, but might be out of date in six months or a year or what have you. That&#8217;s not necessarily something you want in your navigation. So, narrowing that scope I think makes it a little bit easier to find links.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, thank you so much for jumping in there. I was drawing a blank. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, absolutely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The navigation in terms of posts, you probably would link more to category pages where a list of posts on a certain topic are there. The narrowing down of the scope is really helpful for the user there. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. The next one I&#8217;m really happy about because now I get a confirmation when I move a post to trash.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: We have had so many accidental deletions of the homepage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I was going through the developer notes and somehow I had a post published that was previously by accident deleted, came back from trash, and then had trashed in the permanent link. So, it was really, &#8220;What?&#8221; So I needed to just delete the permanent link and then it would automatically create a normal link, but it was kind of, &#8220;Huh? Why would that be?&#8221; So having a confirmation yes or no, do you really want to trash it, because it had so many ramifications to rectify that situation again. Yes, it was really hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: So the next one is it&#8217;s titled add template replace flow to template inspector. What it really boils down to is it looks like there is a change to just the way that you replace a template when you&#8217;re editing a page. When I was diving a little bit deeper into this, I feel like this is maybe a first pass or that there are some more passes of this to come, because I did see some comments that the UI could be streamlined a little bit more than it is, but there&#8217;s a great video that demonstrates this, where you are on the page editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can go and replace a template and then it brings you to this modal where you can choose whatever template that you want. It gives you a bunch of selections. You can choose one and your page just updates to that new template and then you can just go about your day. I recommend checking that out. It might be something, especially if you&#8217;re heavily using templates, something to keep an eye on for future updates as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So before it was just a dropdown box in the site bar for the pages, and now it opens up a modal. So, you actually can preview the template that you would associate it with a page if you want to change it. So, I think that&#8217;s a really good way to think about templates that &#8220;Oh, I can reorganize the content on this page by just changing another template.&#8221; I get a preview on how that&#8217;s going to look because we are all about avoiding that piece where we say safe and pray. I think Helen Hou-Sandi uses it a lot. That&#8217;s the previous way to do editing, is you do something and then you need to look at frontend how it looks, and the block editor is all about what you see is what you get.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Before I heavily relied on preview, which some of the previous updates to the previous functionality I was very thankful for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. Then the next one were updates in the block library. The search block got some enhancements and one is to allow the space for the input field only when the form expands and not when it&#8217;s collapsed. That was always a little bit hard to place. Then the alignment and the icon button got a little correction on the width, so it looks a little bit more streamlined. The search block is an odd block. I really liked it, but it&#8217;s always a little harder for me to add it to a navigation block definitely. But even if you want to have it standalone on top of your blog post or something like that on a template, it&#8217;s always a little bit harder to organize, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi:</em> Yeah, I can see that. So, the next changeup is in the site editor, and it&#8217;s something regarding the template parts. So, basically, we are no longer displaying the navigation section in the template parts details when the menu is missing, which sounds very obvious. If there&#8217;s no navigation menu, don&#8217;t display it. So, there&#8217;s some great screenshots that illustrate this in the GitHub issue. Very, very straightforward in those details. If there&#8217;s no navigation menu, you just don&#8217;t see the navigation in the details for that template part.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: These are the quality of life issues or things that you don&#8217;t know unless you read the changelog. Oh, we needed to change that. Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The next one that I want to point out was for the font library, unfortunately, it&#8217;s not going to be in 6.4, but the management screens got a new tab and that is for the font uploads. So, if you as a user want to add additional fonts to your site, you can upload that. That was before, but now you have a separate tab for it. Before it was you needed to scroll all the way down past all the fonts and go to the upload section. Now it&#8217;s just one tab. So, it&#8217;s much easier to find. Unfortunately, for many, many people, we won&#8217;t have it in 6.4. It definitely needed more time to get finished, especially in the rest API endpoints and then have more testing going on, because I think it was only in 16.7 that it actually was merged into Gutenberg.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They tried for two beta sessions to get it actually to a place where users can really use it. There were always something. So, the release team said, &#8220;Well, I think that&#8217;s a sign that we need to have it simmer for more moments, for a few more rounds in the Gutenberg plugin and have some more testing being done because it&#8217;s not ready yet.&#8221; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: That makes sense. I&#8217;m looking forward to it for the next version of Core, but that sounds like a really nice update. The next update affects the list views. So, there were some performance issues when a user or a content editor rather would come in and select all the blocks on the page, and there is now a fix for that. So, this affects pages that have just a lot, a lot of blocks. So, the example in the testing instructions says, &#8220;Add 150 or more paragraphs,&#8221; for example. So, before when a content editor would go in, open list view, do a command + A or control + A to select all of the blocks on the page and there are a couple hundred blocks, the editor would just freeze. It would just freeze up on you because that&#8217;s a lot of information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this particular PR that solves that performance issue. So, they&#8217;re noting that there will be a slight delay for rendering items, but there shouldn&#8217;t be any huge, huge slowdowns to the point where it makes you think that your site is broken.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. No, that&#8217;s for the power users. It&#8217;s not uncommon to have a weakened edition with many, many things and then have a couple hundred blocks in there, because we have a separator block or a spacer block or something like that. Power users really don&#8217;t want their site to be broken especially, or losing content, especially with those large posts. The next one is the image block. With the 6.4 version, the image block becomes a light box feature with it. But this Gutenberg plugin PR that I point out now fixes actually that the duo tone has not been applied to the image in the light box.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you had maybe a gray filter on the duo tone filter on your image, and then people clicked on it, and then on the front end, it still has the image original colors and not the duo tone. There is a reason why there&#8217;s duo tone on an image. That was definitely a bug and it was fixed, but it was so visual that I thought we definitely want to talk about that when people tested it before. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi:</em> Yeah, for sure. Next up is an accessibility fix to what might be my favorite new block or favorite new feature, footnotes. They have added aria labels to the return links. On the footnotes, when you go down, you click on a footnote, you go down to the bottom of the page, you read your footnote. There is a little link at the end of that footnote that will take you back to the main content of the page where you picked up your footnote. Now, there is an aria label, which is great for accessibility. It will tell screen reader users, &#8220;Hey, this is where I&#8217;m going back to.&#8221; Very small but impactful change for people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. You don&#8217;t want to lose your place in the post just because you&#8217;re following a footnote and not going back to where it was. Yeah, same for the table of content block. There have been quite a few accessibility improvements. Them missing was actually part of the reason why the table of content block that&#8217;s in the plugin actually did not make it into WordPress 6.4 because it was not complete from how you access it. Even for the abled people, it was really hard to use the table of content, because it didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of styling options. With additional accessibility of movements, now it can be tested more and in a broader reach as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: I would throw this under accessibility as well. There is a small fix to the patterns, where for a block pattern that is not synced, the terminology that was being used for that was they were using standard. So, this change replaces that use of the word standard, to use not synced instead for block patterns that are not synced. I think that makes it more obvious, because standards can be&#8230; What is standard? Some people might have questions, but it just brings a level of clarity to what&#8217;s going on there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, especially in patterns, because right now, we only have two, but we will have a third type of pattern and that will be partially synced. So, a standard, what is that? So that it really brings it home. Yeah, thank you for pointing that out as well. I think I skipped over one of the documentation items that I wanted to point out for our listeners who are looking a little bit further beyond the WordPress Gutenberg usage. Oh, that&#8217;s the real-time collaboration experiment is now switched. You can switch that on in 16.8, and there&#8217;s also a document now available in the block editor handbook about the current state of the real-time collaboration experiment. So, you can follow along on what&#8217;s going to be next year for the Gutenberg editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a lot of documentation changes, don&#8217;t get us wrong, but they&#8217;re mostly removing redundant stuff like remove the full site editing documentation because it will be in the themes handbook. Rename block hooks to block filters, because now block hooks are a different feature. So, it&#8217;s all a little bit, but the team is really working very hard to get the documentation up to par with 6.4 as well. Yeah, I think that was the changelog for 16.8, the Gutenberg plugin version. Thank you so much for going through that with me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Deveopment or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are now at the section what&#8217;s in active development or what&#8217;s in discussed. I would say with WordPress 6.4 almost out the door, Gutenberg developers are shifting gears now and also working on some new things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those need your input opinion, design use, and I share with you in the show notes four links. The first one would be a media library proof of concept in the site editor. The contributor has done some really experiment with that on how to add images right through your media library there, have a list view there. Now, list view, not from the editor but from a list of media and how you can navigate that and how you can preview that and all that. So, that&#8217;s really a first version of it. Take a look. It&#8217;s not yet merged. The PR itself has been closed. I just see that, but there is a replacement of that, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah. That PR in particular is labeled as purely an experiment, but at the top of that PR, there is a great video that demonstrates this proof of concept, which I personally really like it. I think it&#8217;s far more intuitive. It only shows the list view. There is also a grid view that if you dive a little bit more into the PR, you can see some screenshots of the grid view as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The developer now that his experiments, he went through them, he now opened a tracking issue on GitHub called Collaboration Media Library. I&#8217;m sure there will be quite a few discussion threads going on there. The whole feature is now divided up into certain tasks and defines a little bit more than scope and all that. So, you can read up more about what the developers are thinking right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, this is exciting. It&#8217;s nice to see the media library getting a little bit of love here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it definitely needs a lot of love. Yes, I have seen tickets or track tickets that are 18 years old and you say, &#8220;Okay, yeah, I wonder if we ever get categories for our media libraries or better views or bulk updates, all kinds of things.&#8221; So if you look at the track tickets that are concerned in the media library, there are quite a few that could use some love.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. The second link of what active development or discussed is introduce an experimental form and input blocks to allow building basic forms. So, the ecosystem of WordPress has a huge amount of plugins that help you with creating forms. Forms are very, very important. A lot of interactivity is built on top of forms and there has been a 15-year history of what forms need to be or could be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ari did an experiment to figure out, &#8220;Okay, if we had a standard on how blocks are built for forms, maybe the plugins can build on top of the standards.&#8221; Then when you switch out the plugin for forms, it wouldn&#8217;t destroy all your forms and you had to recreate them. Of course, some of the plugins have imports of other plugins forms, but that&#8217;s just good common sense because otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t be able to sell to existing customers or those who have existing forms. That is definitely something that&#8217;s merged in Gutenberg already.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an experiment, so when you activate Gutenberg in your website, you could scroll down to the menu Gutenberg and then there is a section there called experiments. There you can switch on the experiment you are interested in. So, this one actually also deals with block bindings, data bindings, and that kind of thing. So, it&#8217;s going to be really interesting to see what you think when you use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, this is an exciting one because I can see in the future people creating block patterns for just really common use cases. So, the demo video shows like a send a message pattern, but I see patterns all over the internet for subscribe to my newsletter, get on my mailing list, things like that. Forms are so common on sites in general. I&#8217;m excited about this one too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, all really good too. There are even some plugins that actually provide input blocks already, but also, it narrows down the openness again when you have to have a separate plugin for your forms and then what happens afterwards when you don&#8217;t use the plugin anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, exactly. Having this just part of Core is great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really good. Then the third one is for the insiders of using React quite a bit is that the default JSX import is done through React rather than the WordPress elements package. So, it automatically updates when React updates and the front page of WordPress elements package is actually a wraparound the React package. So, taking it out, taking the JSX feature out of that makes it more streamlined with React.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Yeah, for sure. Just for clarity, for block creators, this should not affect your code at all. This is really just how JSX is getting pulled in. So, if you&#8217;re using JSX, you should not need to change anything. This is really a very backend change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and the WordPress elements package will still be around because it&#8217;s already in Core and there is this backwards compatibility promise as well. Yeah, yeah. So, thank you for pointing it out. There&#8217;s always this fear. Are there breaking changes? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: That was my first thought when I read that one actually. That&#8217;s why I wanted to point it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, thank you. So, good to have you on the show, Joni. You pointed out quite a few things that I didn&#8217;t think about. So, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the last one on the section what&#8217;s active or what&#8217;s discussed is that the Gutenberg has now new labels for the data views. Normally, I wouldn&#8217;t point out new labels at the Gutenberg repo that come and go. I think we have about 400 or so labels there. So, yeah, I wouldn&#8217;t do it on the podcast. But with the new admin changes that are coming with the Gutenberg phase number three, many people want to be on the forefront or want to keep track of what&#8217;s happening. Do I have to change things or can I influence how it&#8217;s going and stay on top of it? This new label was created to label for the data views work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, every time there is a custom post type list or a media list in various things, so that in the WP Admin, like your post list, it&#8217;ll all be reimagined in the site editor paradigm kind of thing. The label tracks the high level work for that. So, you can really follow along with that and even subscribe to that without getting the fire hose of the rest of the Gutenberg repo that has a lot of issues and PRs every week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we are at the end of our show today, and I ask every special guest in that section now. So, Joni, if there&#8217;s anything that you want to announce or you want to point out that you didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk about because you didn&#8217;t get a chance, now is your chance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Oh, my.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: How can people reach you? What are you working on? Is there something exciting in your life that you released?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: Nothing coming just yet. I did a talk a little while ago at WordPress Accessibility Day that I think the recordings are coming out. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re already out, but I will announce it on my socials. I am @JoniHalabi almost everywhere, and you can also find me&#8230; I infrequently blog at my website, which is <a href=\"https://jhalabi.com/\">jhalabi.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, yeah, thank you for pointing out the WordPress Accessibility Day. So, what did you present about, what&#8217;s your talk about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: It was actually a plugin that I initially created a while ago. I call it Besan Block, but it is essentially a way to create accessible SVG bar charts on your website and it integrates with Google Sheets. So, you can automatically import your content from a Google sheet and it will create a bar chart. It&#8217;s accessible and tabable and readable by screen readers. So, I walked folks through how to do that. The primary focus of that particular talk was the creation of the accessible SVG.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. Yeah, so I&#8217;m definitely going to mention that in the show notes as well. Is that plugin available in the repo or is it on GitHub?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Joni Halabi</em>: It is. It&#8217;s available in GitHub, but it is also in the WordPress plugin directory. It is called Besan Block, B-E-S-A-N.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: B-E-S-A-N. Okay. I&#8217;ll find it. Thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you for being on the show. As always, the show notes, dear listeners, will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 91. If you have any questions or suggestions or news that you want us to include the next time, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s an email address and it&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. So, thank you so much, Joni, for joining us today. Thank you all of the listeners for listening. If you want, it would be really, really helpful if you would do a review on your favorite podcast app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven&#8217;t had any reviews because we didn&#8217;t ask for it, but it always helps with the distribution of the changelog. Absolutely, you will get it read on the next episode. So, there&#8217;s a little shout-out if it&#8217;s a good review of course. Maybe if it&#8217;s a mediocre review. All right. So, that&#8217;s it. Thank you for listening. Goodbye, and I&#8217;ll talk to you in probably four weeks.

I was at an <a href=\"https://ecoamerica.org/\">EcoAmerica</a> board meeting dinner and afterward instead of calling an Uber like I usually would, I tried a self-driving car, a <a href=\"https://waymo.com/\">Waymo</a>. (The name inspired by my friend, <a href=\"https://jaimewaydo.com/\">Jaime Waydo</a>.) As I got home I was so excited to tell my Mom what just happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like every cell in my body is charged, it&#8217;s like the first time I got a script to run, or committed code into b2/cafelog, this is definitely a before and after moment. Here&#8217;s a video as the car arrived and I got out. I&#8217;m really at a loss for words. The &#8220;wow&#8221; you hear me say in one of my most genuine in my life. The thing is <em>I know</em> these self-driving cars exist, I&#8217;ve seen them around San Francisco forever, but the <em>experience</em> of being picked up and dropped off by a robot navigating the tricky SF hills and streets just hits different.</p>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> </div>\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“The future is already here – it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.&#8221; </p>\n<cite>William Gibson</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that always brings me back to San Francisco is you feel like you&#8217;re living in the future.

Companies can host up to 100 static sites for free, including static WordPress sites, which Kinsta deploys from its global edge network of more than 300 locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Static sites are those that serve HTML pages, media, and assets like JavaScript and CSS. These are usually more suitable for brochure websites, landing pages, personal portfolios, and other simple sites that don&#8217;t require pages to be dynamically generated by code running on a server. Static sites are generally more performant and secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinsta&#8217;s free static hosting tier comes with the following features and limitations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 concurrent build/site</li>\n\n\n\n<li>100 sites/company</li>\n\n\n\n<li>600 build minutes/month/company</li>\n\n\n\n<li>100 GB bandwidth/month/company</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 GB build size limit/site</li>\n\n\n\n<li>API access</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integration with GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Diff-based Uploads</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom domains</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Free SSL support</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers can host pre-built static sites or sites built with static site generator frameworks that use Node.js. Kinsta has created <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/docs/static-site-hosting/static-site-quick-start-examples/\">quick start example repositories</a> for many popular static site generators, including Astro, Cuttlebelle, Docusaurus, Eleventy, Gatsby, Nuxt, Qwik, React, React with Vite, and VuePress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress users can also deploy static sites to the platform and host it for free by converting an existing site to static. Kinsta published a <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/static-wp-site/\">tutorial</a> on the process for converting a WordPress site using a free plugin. The static hosting can also be used to set up a frontend with any kind of backend or host a headless WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1105\" height=\"1039\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/static-wp-add-static-site.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150366\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Users can launch a static site to Kinsta&#8217;s infrastructure by deploying from a Git repository hosted by BitBucket, GitHub, or GitLab, selecting a branch, and adding a build command and directory to deploy. Kinsta can detect some static site generators automatically, which makes the process easier. A connection and configuration settings can be managed through the MyKinsta dashboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"960\" height=\"935\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kinsta-static-site-build-settings.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150362\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Kinsta plans to introduce add-ons and other features in the future that might be paid, but is committed to keeping the service and this tier free forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Just like with every free product or freemium model, our goal is to spread the word with the help of it and let users try out our service, the dashboard in a frictionless way and host a project here for completely free,&#8221; Kinsta Chief Business Officer Tom Zsomborgi said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The ability of using and testing out a platform and getting first hand experience is the ultimate way of forming an opinion about a provider. We let everyone use the service and host their projects. If the developers and agencies like the Static product we hope they will consider us for their other web projects and start using the paid services.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinsta is targeting enterprises, agencies, and companies that need to create websites and landing pages for high-traffic campaigns. The company is working on more features for static site hosting, including the following on the roadmap:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wildcardless domains</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Extended Kinsta API support</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serverless functions, which could be utilized by static sites</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Previews</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maintenance mode</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Password protection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability for HTML Forms to work</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More builders</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose a build template</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Detailed Analytics</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinsta&#8217;s static site hosting solution is similar to what the competition offers for building and deploying sites, but Zsomborgi said he thinks that having application, database, and WordPress hosting all under one roof sets them apart. Kinsta also offers analytics for free and unlimited users/seats, the same as Vercel, but Netlify only offers these under paid plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The biggest things that we are missing are functions (Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Pages have them) and deploy previews,&#8221; Zsomborgi said. &#8220;Both of those are in the backlog and will be released soon.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 22:18:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WordPress.org blog: A New WordPress Showcase\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=16173\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/10/a-new-wordpress-showcase/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4919:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/meta/\">journey to update WordPress.org</a> continues with the launch of a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/\">Showcase</a> design. The Showcase is a natural starting point for visitors arriving on WordPress.org, and it both inspires creativity and demonstrates what’s possible with WordPress. From unique personal blogs and portfolios to enterprises and celebrity fan sites, the Showcase celebrates WordPress’s flexibility, popularity, and the freedom to own one’s content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"954\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/10/2-showcase-site-1.png?resize=1024%2C954&ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshots from the new Showcase design\" class=\"wp-image-16187\" />\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"954\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/10/3-showcase-starry-theme-1.png?resize=1024%2C954&ssl=1\" alt=\"A grid of new design elements\" class=\"wp-image-16184\" />\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/10/4-showcase-websites-curaction-1.png?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1\" alt=\"A collage of Showcased websites\" class=\"wp-image-16185\" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>This new design provides much-needed improvements to the aesthetics and user experience. It emphasizes bold visuals and a more dynamic browsing experience through tags and categories. Individual site pages now include desktop and mobile screenshots, while the site introduces an improved layout on mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This redesign also brings new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/blocks/\">block-based functionality</a> and several components that will be used elsewhere on WordPress.org. All of this was made possible through collaboration between Design, Marketing, and Meta teams.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how we can promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in the WordPress project and community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Pooja Derashri. Pooja is a co-founder of WPVibes, a plugin development company based in India. With a passion for WordPress, pooja has been actively involved in the community since 2013. Her journey as a contributor began in 2017 when she attended her first local WordCamp. Her expertise and dedication have under various key roles in the WordPress ecosystem. She currently serves as co-team rep for the training team, and GTE for the Hindi local. In addition, she holds key positions in the WordPress release squad for version 6.3 and 6.4, where she heads up the test team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja shares her insights on the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging within the WordPress community, and explores how you don&#8217;t need to be a coder to be a part of the community and all that it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the work of teams like polyglots, who focus on translating WordPress projects into different languages, and docs, who provide much needed documentation to help users understand and contribute to the platform. These initiatives alone make it clear that WordPress is reliant on non-coding contributions, and there are more ways to contribute than have a before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ask Pooja about her experiences with diversity and inclusivity in the tech industry, and she reflects on the challenges she has faced, discussing the importance of recognizing and addressing unconscious biases. She shares her insights on the need for training and workshops that empower diverse individuals to contribute and speak up within the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We delve into Birgit Olzem&#8217;s proposal to form an official D E I B team within WordPress, aiming to implement diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging throughout the whole community. I express my excitement about the potential outcome of this proposal, and we think about how WordPress compares to other parts of the tech industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore the various initiatives and efforts being made to build a more inclusive WordPress culture. From mentorship programs, to targeted outreach and safe spaces, we uncover the ways in which underrepresented voices are being uplifted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in creating a more inclusive community, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Pooja Derashri</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Pooja Derashri. Hello Pooja!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Hi Nathan. So glad to join you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah thank you for joining me today. We&#8217;re going to be talking a little bit today about a subject which you may well have heard me talk about before. I had an interview with Jill Binder and Birgit Olzem quite recently. This episode is going to follow on shortly after that. We&#8217;re going to be talking about an acronym, DEIB or Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into the subject at hand though. Pooja I wonder, would you mind just introducing yourself? Tell us a bit about who you are, where you are, and what it is that brought you to WordPress, what it is that you do within WordPress and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:50] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Yeah. My name is Pooja Derashri, and I am from India. I&#8217;m a co founder of WPVibes, a plugin development company, and I am also a WordPress contributor. Currently I&#8217;m a co team rep for the training team and GTE for Hindi locale. Along with this, I&#8217;m also in the WordPress release squad for 6.3 and 6.4, where I&#8217;m leading the test team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically I&#8217;ve been working in WordPress since 2013. But my contribution journey started in 2017 when I was first introduced to WordPress community in one of the local WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s an amazing story. You&#8217;ve got a lot of past, and heritage, and interest in the community. I&#8217;m guessing if you are part of the WordPress community and you&#8217;ve been part of the release squad, and it sounds like you are attending events and things like that as well. You&#8217;ve got a real interest in the community being diverse, equitable, inclusive, and the last word in the acronym, belonging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to just tell us a little bit about how you came to be interested in this subject? Obviously, if you&#8217;ve got a plugin development company, one might expect that all of your endeavours would be towards coding and plugins and documentation and all of those kind of things, but clearly not. You&#8217;ve got an interest in all of these things. Tell us why it is that you&#8217;ve found this to be important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:13] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Yes. Basically I have a short story to tell about. In my region, where I&#8217;m belonging, there is a conception that women are not good for tech jobs and women can&#8217;t do coding. In my first job there were members of 10 to 12 in my company. They have a stereotype thinking that women are not for the tech jobs, women are not good for tech jobs. And at that time I feel like an outsider, and I&#8217;m not good for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that company they were not giving me challenging tasks, and they were just giving me simple, easy tasks. So I was thinking like, what am I doing here? Then soon I realised, I switched from that company, in just two months. Then I joined a different company which is far better than that company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there I got respected. I was welcomed. They gave me equal chances to work, and they gave me equal opportunities to work on coding. That was quite a nice experience. If I was not being treated unfairly, then I would never know about how that feeling was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I got that feeling, then I searched about and heard in a workshop, what is DEIB, and why it matters? And I just connected the dots, like I similarly faced that issue in my first job and I should do something about it. So in my opinion diversity is all about making sure that everyone feels welcome, respected and treated fairly no matter who they ,are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. That&#8217;s a really interesting story that you&#8217;ve got there. I wonder if we might just delve into that a little bit more deeply. You obviously had two fairly different experiences there. One, which was fairly negative, and you wish to separate yourself from that company and go and work at a different company. And it sounds like that was a much better experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re obviously coming out of India on this call today. Do you feel that this is a problem which is systemic where you live? Do you, in other words, feel that this bias, for want of a better word, this lack of diversity and equity and inclusion, is something which is endemic where you live? So what I&#8217;m really asking is, do you think that there&#8217;s a problem in your part of the world that maybe isn&#8217;t quite so pronounced in other parts of the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:44] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Yeah. Actually I come from a rural background where people have held certain fixed mindsets, and they are being biased in some situations. So yeah, we can say that they are not treated, they are thinking like this tech world is only for male or something like that, particularly in my region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not talking about the whole of India. We have some better mindsets, and better conceptions in other part of India. But in my region, in my small city, that is a very unfair, or we can say biased, conception or misconception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you for that. I wonder if there&#8217;s legislation in place in your part of the world to tackle this kind of thing. And whether or not there&#8217;s legislation, doesn&#8217;t of course mean that it does not happen, I think the same would be true in other parts of the world as well. Simply because there are laws to prevent this kind of thing, doesn&#8217;t mean that those laws are obeyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So quick question around that, we&#8217;ll go off piste for a moment. In the part of the world where you are, is there laws around this kind of thing, around discrimination and inclusion? In other words, from a legal point of view, is this not tolerated?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:58] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Yes we have very tough laws on these things. But we can&#8217;t change any person&#8217;s conception. But I was lucky enough that my parents were not thinking that if a female can do that. They gave us equal rights. For my in laws, they gave me the equal opportunities and encouraged me, motivated me always to do whatever I wanted to do. So it&#8217;s about the few people in my first company. They had that mindset but not every people is going with the same mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have a follow up question, and it&#8217;s about the place where you described first, the job where that organisation wasn&#8217;t particularly diverse, and they certainly don&#8217;t sound like they were particularly inclusive. Was there any part of you that felt like throwing in the towel? And what I mean by that is just thinking okay this is what tech is like, I&#8217;m just going to change industry altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it sounds like you have got a background where you described your parents making sure that everything was equal for you. But despite that, did you at any point think well if this is what the tech industry is going to be like, I&#8217;m not going to be a part of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I wonder really if that&#8217;s the root of the problem here. In that we&#8217;re trying to get it to the point where no person, no matter what their background is, no matter what their ethnicity is or religion or whatever it may be. Where they feel that they can&#8217;t be part of the industry because they&#8217;re getting signals from their employers, and the industry more broadly that they don&#8217;t belong. So yeah, the question basically is, did you ever feel like, okay I shan&#8217;t be part of tech if this is what it&#8217;s going to be like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:43] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> No, I never thought that. I was always encouraged by my close circle that you should do whatever you want, despite what other people think. You should face that problem and overcome from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought in my first job that if they are not accepting me and they are not finding me good enough then, why shouldn&#8217;t I change the job? I can&#8217;t change their mindset but I can change my job. I can change my company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah that&#8217;s a very enlightening approach, isn&#8217;t it? Okay so you&#8217;ve laid out what the problem is. I think this question may be not particularly relevant, but I would be interested to know. Why do you find this to be so important a cause? I mean it&#8217;s obvious the answer to that, isn&#8217;t it? But I want to hear you express in your own words why you&#8217;ve attached yourself to this and why you believe it&#8217;s important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:36] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> DEIB basically means we are making a big circle of friends where everyone is invited, treated fairly and feels like they are one of them. And it is important because when people work, play, and live together with love and respect, then the world becomes a happier and stronger place for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we talk about open source projects, open source projects make sure that everyone is included and feels they belong to this community. It encourages other people to come and share their skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is important basically because our world will be more happier, stronger, and people live with peace and harmony. If they are not biased, they are living together with respect. All person are welcomed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What a lovely answer. I&#8217;m really quite touched by that, that&#8217;s beautiful. The next thing that you wanted to talk about is really interesting to me, because I haven&#8217;t given this too much thought. And it&#8217;s the idea that the problem may not be something that people are necessarily conscious of. And in the share notes that you&#8217;ve shared with me, you&#8217;ve talked about this thing called unconscious bias. And I have an intuition as to what you&#8217;re meaning there but I&#8217;d like you to explain that. What is unconscious bias? Let&#8217;s delve into that a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Basically, a sneaky or hidden friend in your mind, brain. Who sometimes make a decision for you, without you even realising it. For example, imagine your favorite color is blue. Sometimes without thinking much, you choose blue color in everything, because your brain automatically likes them. What if that happens with people not color? If your mind is unconsciously like a certain kind of people then you will be not inclusive in environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the idea being that, and I guess we can all admit to this in many aspects of our lives, we have things that instinctively, we can&#8217;t quite necessarily understand why, there are certain things that we are drawn to. The taste of a particular meal, a particular color, the kind of vacation that you want to go on, the kind of things that you like to do in your spare time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all of these biases, that have crept into our lives over time, and we may not be aware of them but they impact the decisions that we make. So we may feel that we&#8217;re being equal and thoughtful, and we&#8217;re giving everybody the greatest opportunity possible. But somehow, somewhere, our brain is stepping in and making a slightly different decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that&#8217;s the case, how do you spot your unconscious bias? Because, by definition, it&#8217;s unconscious. You&#8217;re unaware that it&#8217;s happening, but clearly there must be a way of short circuiting that problem, and figuring out, okay take a step back, have a think about that, was that the right decision? What&#8217;s the conversation that you need to have with yourself or your colleagues, or whatever it may be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:38] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Yeah. When you or your colleague indicate that you are facing unconscious biased to someone, for example, I will explain this with a core contributor example. Like imagine two programmers submitting code changes to a project. One programmer is well known to the community, and the other is new and less known, less famous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to our unconscious bias, the community might pay more attention to the code changes from the well known programmer, assuming that they are of higher quality. But it is not like that. Your newcomer can be a good coder and he might of submitted a nice or similar coding. This can lead to the new programmer&#8217;s contribution being overlooked or undervalued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we are doing this kind of bias then we are not doing intentionally. This is something unconsciously we are doing, if we say about in open source. So when someone indicates this to us, first we should accept that we are becoming a biased person for some particular coder, or some particular person. Then we should self realise that how we can give both of them a fair chance by looking into their code or by giving them fair opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s very difficult, isn&#8217;t it, to be as reflective as that. So I would imagine that in almost any unconscious bias that you may have, be it towards code or, you know the kind of food that you like, there is something very deep in that. And so when somebody points it out that you have a bias, sometimes the shutters go up if you like, and you feel that that&#8217;s a, well I guess you could describe it as a personal attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve been biased there. You&#8217;ve clearly exhibited some bias. It&#8217;s not always straightforward to admit to yourself that you have these biases. And so I guess that&#8217;s the enterprise that we&#8217;re going to discuss now. How do we build an inclusive culture? In which people are able to recognise that, yes they have biases, yes they need to pay attention to that, or at least listen to other people&#8217;s opinions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s move on to that. Your third point, if you like, building inclusive cultures. Before we get into the meat and the bones of that, I&#8217;d like to ask what you think broadly about how WordPress as a community is doing with all of this. Because it feels like at the moment this is a particularly hot topic, for want of a better word. It feels like it&#8217;s getting lots of coverage, lots of endeavors are being made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not making the claim that everything is perfect, but it feels like this is a conversation which is becoming increasingly normal. We&#8217;re constantly being told about this and we&#8217;re constantly alert and aware of this. So, how do you think we do as a community, the WordPress community? What can we do, and how are we doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:32] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Actually in my perspective taking the DEIB initiative doesn&#8217;t mean just ticking the boxes. It is all about where people feel they are among all of us. And nurturing the community of where everyone feels respected, valued, and their voices are heard. As you said, this is already a hot topic that is discussed everywhere in the community right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Few of the initiatives, in my opinion, are very great, WordPress community is taking. Like WordPress 6.4 release, it is lead by all women, and non binary people. So that many underrepresented people will get a chance to be part of the release squad, in spite of their background or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another way, if we speak about workshop, that is a great initiative. Like Jill Binder is doing workshops on diversity in every part of the world. And for a few years Jill Binder has been running a workshop, and promoting and uplifting diverse people who are not so comfortable in public speaking, but are expert in their respective fields. There she&#8217;s uplifting them, and creating an inclusive environment. So they feel comfortable, and can deliver their talk, and can be a part of this WordPress family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the great examples, great initiatives taken by Birgit Olzem, she submitted a proposal for forming an official Make WordPress DEIB team, so that DEIB can be implemented in every aspect of WordPress, with every WordPress Make team, and can align with other make teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be discussed in the community summit. I guess today this is going to be discussed. I must say I&#8217;m really excited, what happened and what the outcome and decision was made on this topic. And I would be really happy if this team was to be in existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you heard about a month ago, there was a mentorship program initiated by Hari Shanker. Initiatives taken by Hari Shanker started a project called Mentorship Program, Contributor Mentorship Program. In this a dedicated mentor is assigned to a mentee, or what we say, new contributor who wants to contribute to WordPress, but doesn&#8217;t know how to contribute, how to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the mentor can guide them, and help them to onboard as a contributor. Basically they are creating a path for them to feel included in this environment and get settled. As soon as they join they feel belonging. They have a sense of belonging in this WordPress community as soon as they join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was great I must say. It was a pilot project but it was a great success. So many contributers who are now regularly contributing to the WordPress projects, and bringing their fresh ideas and innovation to that. So these are a few examples or initiatives community is taking now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How do you feel then about how the WordPress community is doing? I should add that I will link in the show notes to the make.wordpress.org piece which is talking about the establishment of a diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging team. And there&#8217;s also, as I said, an episode with Birgit and Jill which you can find in the WP Tavern podcast archive if you want to go a little bit deeper, but I will link to those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you feel that wordPress as a community is doing in comparison to other parts of the tech industry? Do you feel that WordPress is perhaps at the cutting edge? Or are we taking our cues from other communities which have been there, done that, tackled this problem before us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels a lot of the things that WordPress is doing are fairly innovative. So we are having to create, as a community, these things for ourselves. But I could be wrong about that. So perhaps we could just have a chat about whether WordPress is at the vanguard of this or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:00] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Yes, in my opinion if we go back five or ten years back in WordPress community then the WordPress community was not that diverse. But in the past few years the community is taking diversity very seriously, and taking a great initiative so every person all across the globe can share their feelings, or share their ideas, and they are implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m taking one of my example, when I joined the training team in 2019, the team was gearing up for the initial WordPress launch. Then Courtney Robertson and Hauwa Abashiya was the team rep at that time. And I was like, I was having a coding background, I don&#8217;t know about how content works, and how I can contribute and help in that. They helped me in a lot in onboarding to the training team, and they helped me to learn the process. And soon after I got involved and Learn WordPress launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that we worked hard on the training team to make it as diverse across the globe. That time from basically APAC region, there was not much contribution. So we created an inclusive environment in team, everyone can come and ask everything. We were available. We all work from different parts of the world. So we can say we were available 24 hours at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were trying our best to treat everyone equally, no matter where they are from. At that time I started APAC meetings to boost the contribution in this region. We run some workshops to explain what the training team, and what it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand the true meaning of how a diverse team can work together to raise awareness and bring all other members on board, and then they can become a part of the regular contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah thank you. The fifth part that I&#8217;ve got written down here in our shared show notes is your desire to make sure that underrepresented voices are empowered. And I wonder if you could expand on that a little bit. What was it that you were meaning there? Who are you meaning by underrepresented? What are the things that need to be done in order to empower those voices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:35] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> So it depends. If we talk about the tech world, basically in the programming field there are more male coders involved in comparison. Not like I&#8217;m saying all programmers are male, but in comparison to that there are more male representative are there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of representation can be based on various factors just like gender, race, ethnicity, age, geographic location. There can be a more diverse perspective and less inclusive community that can be underrepresented. Few examples like female minorities, people of color, non English speakers, developing countries, accessibility advocates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One more example can be non technical roles, LGBTQ+ individuals. It&#8217;s important to address the underrepresented of these groups to ensure that the WordPress community is diverse, inclusive, and welcoming to everyone. No matter who they are and what background they came from. As a community, our efforts to promote diversity and inclusion can include targeted outreach, like some mentorship programs, creating a safe space, providing them resources if they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your question was, how can we empower the underrepresented voices? It&#8217;s crucial for creating a more diverse and inclusive environment in community, or in an organisation, or in industries, including open source or WordPress community. We can amplify their achievements like recognising and highlighting their contributions, and provide them equal opportunities and their voices are heard in bigger roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can provide diverse leadership. We can create a safe space for them so they feel comfortable in speaking, or in putting their skills in front of everyone. Basically a long term commitment, empowering in underrepresented voices is an ongoing effort. It requires consistent dedication, and a commitment to sustainable change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m curious in your last little portion there you mentioned quite a few different things. When I hear conversations around diversity and inclusion and DEIB in general, there are certain topics which come into my mind, and it might be things in the community which I&#8217;ve heard of recently. So I don&#8217;t know, it might be that there&#8217;s equal representation at WordPress events, that we make sure that the speaker lineup is diverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But curious there that you listed out quite a few other things as well. So for example, just geographical, the spread of where you are on the planet. You need to think perhaps differently depending on where you&#8217;re based, and the metrics by which you would measure how you&#8217;re doing in this sphere may be different in, for example, India than it would be where I am in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it doesn&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s one size fits all. There&#8217;s no standard operating procedure for making sure this is all done correctly. Different parts of the world may be on a different journey and have a different trajectory, and have different things that they need to focus on. Would you say that&#8217;s true?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:10] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Yes, different parts of countries may have different perceptions regarding diversity. I agree with your point that our WordPress related events are focusing on diverse speaker lineup. If we check our WordCamp US speaker lineup, that is much diverse. And similarly in WordCamp Asia, where I was part of speaker organising teams, we put our full efforts in creating a diverse speaker lineup. So yeah, I completely add with your point. We might have different perceptions, we might have different geographical location. There are different means of diversity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now inevitably when this kind of conversation comes around, there are always people in the community who have a very different opinion. And they have the opinion that, well really I&#8217;m only here for the code. I want to be able to download the WordPress code base, I want to be able to use WordPress, I want to make it the foundation of my business and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they push back and they say look conversations like this, they&#8217;re not relevant. It&#8217;s code, that&#8217;s all it is to me. What do you say to them? Clearly you would have a different opinion but, how do we get those people interested, and make it so that they feel that this is important? Because I feel that there&#8217;s quite a few members of the community who just say oh, can we just concentrate on the code? We don&#8217;t need to be worried too much about all these other tangential things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:41] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> If we talk about specifically WordPress, there is nothing we can only do with code. There are other things as well like non code contribution. There are other teams, other contributors that are putting in their efforts to make it a successful project. Like a Polyglots team is putting so many efforts into converting WordPress projects into the other languages, so it can be used by so many other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly if we talk about docs team. Docs team is not putting coding efforts, but they are working on providing documentation so everyone can understand the process. Understand how to use WordPress, how you can build something on it, and how you can contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So basically it is not about you can only do it with code. Diversity in terms of every aspect in non code contribution also matters. The whole community came from coding, non coding and other. All the people came together and built a community. Not only one person or one kind of people, like all coders can build a community. It should be a collective effort and it should be a collective output in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah thank you, I think that was really nicely put. A good explanation of the problem at hand. Yeah that&#8217;s brilliant. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to be a listener to this podcast and some of the messages that you&#8217;ve talked about click with us, and we think, yeah everything that Pooja said, that&#8217;s vitally important. I&#8217;m not involved in it yet. I&#8217;d like to be more involved with it. I wonder if you could give us some pointers as to how you might get involved. Perhaps you could tell us about places that we could go. I can link to anything that you mention in the show notes, so they&#8217;ll all be in there. But also maybe you could highlight some of the people who are doing good work in this area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s obviously, you know you, yourself. But you mentioned Birgit Olzem and you&#8217;ve also mentioned Jill Binder, there&#8217;s a couple of other voices. But maybe there&#8217;s some other literature that you can point us in the direction of. Some websites, some project or endeavour that WordPress itself is doing, so that we can dig into this a little bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:03] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Yes. I would like to mention the mentorship program lead by Hari Shanker. More contributors from diverse community come and join the WordPress project. It is a nice initiative in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress six point release, they can join the WordPress six point release Slack channel and people will go through the process of how release works, and how, if they want to be a part of Core. There is not only they can part of Core by just coding. There are so many other areas like testing, like documentation, marketing, content training team. There are so many other teams they can also join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson is also raising awareness about diversity and she is putting so much effort into onboarding to people from different parts of the world. So yeah these are the few things I would like to mention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s great. Thank you very much. And on a more personal note, if somebody has listened to this and they would like to make contact with you. Do you have a web page or a social media profile that you would point people towards?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:17] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> I&#8217;m available on Twitter at PoojaDerashri, the same handle as my name, P O O J A D E R A S H R I. I&#8217;m available on Make WordPress Slack channel. So if anyone wants to contact me they can contact me through Twitter or Make Slack WordPress channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well Pooja, thank you for joining me today. I think I have asked all of the questions that I wish to ask. I&#8217;ll just end by giving you the opportunity, if there was anything else that you wanted to add. If not I will say thank you very much for joining us and giving us some really important information about this really important subject. So over to you if there&#8217;s anything that I missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:00] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> No actually you have covered everything very well and I think there is nothing I would like to mention in hand. Just one thing I would like to state here, I heard in one of the workshops by Jill Binder that many underrepresented are experts. She shared in one of the workshops where people sometimes have a misconception that there are two different type of people, like WP experts and the underrepresented. But there is not something like that. My personal conception was changed after hearing her workshop that she stated that many underrepresented people are also experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay thank you. Pooja Derashri, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:51] <strong>Pooja Derashri:</strong> Thank you. Thank you so much</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/poojaderashri\">Pooja Derashri</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja is a co-founder of <a href=\"https://wpvibes.com/\">WPVibes</a>, a plugin development company based in India. With a passion for WordPress, Pooja has been actively involved in the community since 2013. Her journey as a contributor began in 2017, when she attended her first local WordCamp. Her expertise and dedication have earned her various key roles in the WordPress ecosystem. She currently serves as a co-team rep for the training team and GTE for the Hindi locale. In addition, she holds key positions in the WordPress release squad for versions 6.3 and 6.4, where she heads up the test team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja shares her insights on the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging within the WordPress community, and explores how you don’t need to be a coder to be a part of the community and all that it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the work of teams like Polyglots, who focus on translating WordPress projects into different languages, and Docs, who provide much needed documentation to help users understand and contribute to the platform. These initiatives alone make it clear that WordPress is reliant on non-coding contributions, and there are more ways to contribute than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ask Pooja about her experiences with diversity and inclusivity in the tech industry, and she reflects on the challenges she has faced, discussing the importance of recognising and addressing unconscious biases. She shares her insights on the need for training and workshops that empower diverse individuals to contribute and speak up within the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We delve into Birgit Olzem&#8217;s proposal to form an official DEIB team within WordPress, aiming to implement diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging throughout the whole community. I express my excitement about the potential outcome of this proposal, and we think about how WordPress compares to other parts of the tech industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore the various initiatives and efforts being made to build a more inclusive WordPress culture. From mentorship programs, to targeted outreach and safe spaces, we uncover the ways in which underrepresented voices are being uplifted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in creating a more inclusive community, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links mentioned in the podcast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/94-birgit-olzem-and-jill-binder-on-creating-a-diverse-and-sustainable-wordpress-community\">Jukebox Podcast #94 – Birgit Olzem and Jill Binder on Creating a Diverse and Sustainable WordPress Community</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training team</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/poojaderashri\">Pooja&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links supplied by Pooja in relation to the podcast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HeroPress</a> by Topher DeRosia</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-diversity-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yoast Diversity Fund</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/projects/kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/thewpcc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The WP Community Collective</a>&nbsp;by Courtney Robertson, Sé Reed, and Katie Adams Farrell</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.underrepresentedintech.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Underrepresented in Tech</a>&nbsp;by Allie Nimmons and Michelle Frechette</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpspeakers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WP Speakers</a>&nbsp;by Michelle Frechette</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://womeninwp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Women in WP Show</a> by  Amy Masson,  Tracy Apps, and Angela Bow</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2023/07/13/proposal-for-establishing-a-make-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-belonging-deib-team-within-the-wordpress-community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DEIB Make WordPress team proposal</a> by Birgit Olzem</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Diversity Workshops</a> by  Jill Binder</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2023/08/11/the-inaugural-cohort-of-the-wordpress-contributor-mentorship-program-has-concluded/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contributor Mentorship Program&nbsp;</a>by&nbsp; Hari Shanker</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@gowithwp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Go with WP</a> podcast by the Nepal Community</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Akismet: 10 Powerful AI Marketing Tools to Grow Your Business in 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=281899\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://akismet.com/blog/ai-marketing-tools-for-business/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38655:\"<p>AI (artificial intelligence) has drastically changed the way many industries operate. In particular, there are tons of AI marketing tools that make it quicker and easier to manage (and expand) your business. But with the growing popularity of these tools, you might find it difficult to keep up with your competitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Luckily, you can retain your competitive edge and expand your business by implementing the best AI marketing tools. You can find anti&#8209;spam software, customer service automation tools, email marketing programs, and more that can take care of routine tasks and procedures.

Then, we’ll explore ten of the best AI tools for&nbsp;business.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-281899\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What features should businesses seek in an AI marketing&nbsp;tool?</h2>\n\n\n<p>With the emergence of AI in the marketing industry, it’s much quicker and easier to complete many routine tasks. You can find tools that help you automate email campaigns, research keywords, write content, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re able to get these tasks done faster, you can free up time to invest into other aspects of your business.

Here are some of the main factors to&nbsp;consider:</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Automation. </strong>Automated tools, as the name suggests, work automatically. Since these tasks take place in the background, they often require minimal effort and input once&nbsp;configured.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Customization options. </strong>It’s important to find a solution that offers various customization options. This way, you can create a unique tool that fits in seamlessly with the rest of your business and&nbsp;brand.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Personalization. </strong>The drawback of using automated solutions is that you can end up adopting a one&#8209;size&#8209;fits&#8209;all approach. Still, the best AI marketing tools will provide a great deal of personalization both for you and your&nbsp;customers.</li>\n\n\n<li><strong>Data analytics. </strong>It’s vital to have access to analytics for any marketing activity for your business. This way, you can identify what’s working and what isn’t. Then, you can adjust your approach accordingly.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>With these things in mind, you’ll be better equipped to find the right AI marketing tools to complement your marketing&nbsp;strategy.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The 10 best AI tools for marketing&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<p>Now that you know what to look for in an AI marketing tool, let’s check out ten of the best options to help grow your&nbsp;business.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"866\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image-9.png\" alt=\"Akismet home page design\" class=\"wp-image-282629\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet: AI anti&#8209;spam that boosts conversion&nbsp;rates</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is an automated tool that filters out comment and form spam with an accuracy rating of 99.99 percent.

Here are some key factors to consider when choosing artificial intelligence platforms to&nbsp;implement.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Algorithm type</h3>\n\n\n<p>There are four main types of machine learning algorithms to choose from. Since each algorithm can result in a different level of accuracy and performance, this is an important factor to consider before opting for a particular AI&nbsp;tool.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, supervised learning algorithms can draw conclusions, make estimations, and develop an understanding between different algorithms. Typically, this type of learning is used to analyze trends or make predictions about your&nbsp;content.</p>\n\n\n<p>You can also find tools that rely on semi-supervised learning. This works similarly to supervised learning, but it uses labeled (contains tags to help sort information) and unlabeled data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, unsupervised learning is a great way to identify patterns and correlations. It’s often used to cluster similar data sets for tasks like customer&nbsp;segmentation.</p>\n\n\n<p>Lastly, reinforced algorithms provide a set of parameters to teach the software using trial and error. These tools learn through experience and can adapt their approach according to different situations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Integration with other&nbsp;systems</h3>\n\n<p>While there are plenty of excellent AI tools, it’s important to assess whether the platform will fit nicely within your current workflow. So, it’s a good idea to take a look at the possible integrations, and how easy it is to connect the&nbsp;platforms.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"916\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image-31.png\" alt=\"list of available Akismet integrations\" class=\"wp-image-283390\" />\n\n\n<p>What’s more, it’s best to plan ahead when possible. For example, if you plan on expanding your business, you might be looking to upgrade certain systems. Keep this in mind when selecting your AI marketing tools. This way, you can prevent any future disruptions to your usual&nbsp;procedures.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ease of&nbsp;use</h3>\n\n\n<p>Most platforms that feature AI boast about speed and automation. It’s these qualities that enable you to increase productivity and manage (or monitor) your business more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some AI tools for businesses can be tricky to set up. For instance, some complex platforms can require access to your CRM or other types of data, which can be difficult to establish.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Additionally, while most AI tools don’t require any coding skills, they might not be suitable for beginners. That’s why it’s a good idea to thoroughly read the customer reviews to get a sense of a tool’s&nbsp;usability.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, you can even try a demo or access a free trial first. That way, you can determine whether the tool will be accessible and manageable for everybody on your team. Plus, you can sometimes find free resources and forums where you can gain support and solutions to your&nbsp;problems.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what kind of tool you add to your business (whether AI or not), it’s important to make sure that it’s updated regularly. This way, you know that the development team is still active, and the tool isn’t running outdated technology. You should expect new features to be released, which can give your business a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>But updates are also important for security. That’s because the longer a piece of software has been available, the more likely hackers can find a way around its security barriers. Meaning, outdated software can be used as a backdoor to your site. Plus, most updates come with fixes for common bugs and&nbsp;errors.</p>\n\n\n<p>When you’re dealing with an AI-powered tool specifically, updates are even more vital to the success of your business. This is because AI content creation tools are trained on resources until a certain point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ChatGPT</a> is only trained on data until late 2021. Essentially, if your chosen AI tool isn’t being updated frequently, you risk publishing outdated content, which can affect your search ranking and&nbsp;trustworthiness.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scalability</h3>\n\n\n<p>Typically, when business owners and marketers start looking for new tools, they consider their current situation. But it’s important to consider future plans as well. Are you expecting any significant growth? Does your business fluctuate at certain times of the&nbsp;year?</p>\n\n<p>If this is the case, you can outgrow your new tool and require an upgrade, or, an entirely new solution. Therefore, it’s best to factor this into your decision&#8209;making process. You can even find specific AI marketing tools that offer plans that make it easy to scale resources up and&nbsp;down.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Security and&nbsp;privacy</h3>\n\n<p>One of the most important factors when choosing the best AI tool is security and privacy. You’ll want to make sure that your business is protected, and that any sensitive data like customer information and payment details are kept&nbsp;confidential.</p>\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, pay attention to the tool’s data handling practices, encryption methods, and compliance with regulations like GDPR. That way, you can assess whether there are any risks associated with implementing the tool on your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked questions&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<p>Up to now, we’ve tried to cover everything you need to know about AI marketing tools, but you still may have a few doubts. So, in this section, we’ll answer some of the most common questions on the&nbsp;subject.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do I know which AI marketing tool to&nbsp;choose?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Since there are so many diverse AI marketing tools, it can be difficult to choose the right solution for your business. Typically, this will depend on your own unique needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, Akismet is a great tool for practically every business, since spam will always be an issue for any website. With Akismet, you can block all comment, form, and text spam without the need to manually analyze every submission.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Better yet, Akismet boasts a 99.99% detection accuracy rate. Unlike other anti&#8209;spam solutions such as CAPTCHAs, Akismet performs these tasks without disrupting the user&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can AI tools help businesses improve their marketing&nbsp;strategies?</h3>\n\n<p>There are tons of artificial intelligence tools that can help businesses improve their marketing strategies. Most of these platforms make it easier and quicker to perform certain functions, enabling you to increase your content output and make your campaigns more&nbsp;effective.</p>\n\n\n<p>For instance, you can identify thousands of keywords and topical clusters using a content strategy tool like AI Keyword Insights. Meanwhile, ChatFuel enables you to boost lead generation and revenue across social media marketing apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. Synthesia transforms simple text prompts into engaging videos in just a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does AI help businesses with lead&nbsp;generation?</h3>\n\n\n<p>By implementing the best AI marketing tools, you can improve many aspects of your business, including lead generation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, Akismet is a great way to get more leads on your website. That’s because the tool <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/best-anti-spam-wordpress-plugins-compared/\">protects your site against spam</a> (and the associated risks), without adding friction to the user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many websites ask visitors to prove that they’re not a robot using protocols like CAPTCHA, this can be frustrating for visitors who might decide to exit your page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is more user&#8209;friendly, so it can help you increase conversions and sales on your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the technical requirements for implementing AI tools in&nbsp;marketing?</h3>\n\n\n<p>The requirements for integrating and using AI tools will vary depending on your choice. Adding them to your workflows and practices may take a while, though the efficiency gained will quickly make it a worthwhile effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>But, if your site is on WordPress, implementing Akismet is as easy as installing the plugin directly from your WordPress&nbsp;dashboard.</p>\n\n\n<p>To do this, go to <strong>Plugins </strong>→ <strong>Add New </strong>within your WordPress dashboard. Here, search for “Akismet” and it will be the top option that’s presented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"636\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image-32.png\" alt=\"Akismet plugin in the WordPress dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-283393\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Then, select <strong>Install Now </strong>→ <strong>Activate. </strong>After that, navigate to <strong>Settings </strong>→ <strong>Akismet Anti-Spam.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"316\" height=\"548\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image-33.png\" alt=\"Aksimet Anti-Spam settings in the dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-283394\" />\n\n\n<p>If you already have an API key, click on <strong>Manually enter an API key. </strong>Or, choose <strong>Set up your Akismet&nbsp;account</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"760\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image-34.png\" alt=\"Akismet setup wizard\" class=\"wp-image-283395\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Since the tool starts working automatically, you can start enjoying robust anti-spam protection without lifting a finger.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is an example of an AI tool that addresses a significant marketing&nbsp;challenge?</h3>\n\n<p>One of the biggest challenges in marketing is finding a way to block spam without ruining the user experience. Traditionally, website owners and marketers use methods like CAPTCHA to reduce spam, since this entails the visitor proving that they aren’t a&nbsp;robot.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"770\" height=\"925\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image-35.png\" alt=\"CAPTCHA example with red spheres\" class=\"wp-image-283396\" />\n\n\n<p>The problem with CAPTCHA is that it can lead to fewer conversions since it adds friction to the user experience. This can be frustrating for visitors who might choose to leave your website, ditch your form, or abandon their&nbsp;cart.</p>\n\n<p>But, Akismet is a clever AI tool that filters your comment, text, and form spam automatically. It eliminates the need for CAPTCHA by analyzing submissions in real&#8209;time with 99.99%&nbsp;accuracy.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the benefits of using Akismet’s AI&#8209;powered spam&nbsp;protection?</h3>\n\n<p>There are tons of benefits to using Akismet’s AI&#8209;powered spam protection. First off, it enables you to filter spam from your site without implementing intrusive alternatives like CAPTCHA. This way, you can keep visitors on your website and increase your conversion&nbsp;rate.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet blocks form and comment spam with incredible accuracy. By analyzing any piece of user&#8209;submitted text, you can keep your website better protected against common security&nbsp;threats.</p>\n\n\n<p>What’s more, using Akismet saves site administrators an average of 20 hours per month when it replaces a manual spam filtering process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet provides a flexible API, so it’s easy to build it into any enterprise application your organization may&nbsp;use.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What types of companies generally use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet is a powerful anti&#8209;spam solution that can be used by complete beginners. But, it’s also a great option for small businesses and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">large&nbsp;enterprises</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>For instance, there are currently over 100 million websites using the AI-powered Akismet tool. Some of these brands include Microsoft, WordPress.com, Bluehost, and ConvertKit. And across these websites, Akismet has blocked over 545,000,000,000 pieces of spam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: AI&#8209;powered spam protection that boosts conversion&nbsp;rates</h2>\n\n<p>AI marketing tools can simplify many aspects of running your business. This way, you can complete tons of tasks in a much shorter time frame. Plus, you can offload routine procedures and free up time to invest into other areas of your business, like&nbsp;growth.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, you might want to implement a tool like <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/\">Grammarly</a> to enhance your copy. <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a> can enable you to build custom workflows by connecting tons of apps. Or you could use a tool like <a href=\"https://www.synthesia.io/\">Synthesia</a> to create high&#8209;quality videos with no&nbsp;equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Akismet provides robust anti&#8209;spam protection. Using advanced AI, Akismet filters out comment and form spam with 99.99% accuracy. Better yet, user submissions are analyzed in real time, and Akismet works without disrupting the user experience. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">Get started with Akismet&nbsp;today</a>!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Matt: Cost of Spam\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=101397\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://ma.tt/2023/10/cost-of-spam/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1551:\"<p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/10/17/twitter-x-charging-new-users-1-dollar-year-to-tweet/\">Twitter/X is testing charging users $1/year</a> with the idea that will keep out bots and spam. It&#8217;s an appealing idea, and charging definitely does introduce a &#8220;proof of work&#8221; that wasn&#8217;t there before, but the history of the web shows this is not really a big deterrent. Domains cost money, usually a lot more than a dollar a year, and millions are used for spam or nefarious purposes. The spammers obviously thought their benefit would be more than the cost of the domain, or they use stolen credit cards and identities. Charging may cause a short-term drop in bots while the bad guys update their scripts, but the value of manipulating X/Twitter is so high I imagine there is already millions of dollars being spent on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long term to keep a platform healthy you really have to take a nuanced look at behavior and content, like Automattic does with <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>, and have a fairly sophisticated trust and safety operation with great engineers.

I think it&#8217;s a big deal to have this continuity and consistency in something.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This anniversary also marks nine years of being part of the WordPress community. But let&#8217;s start from the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-journalism-to-content-writing\">From journalism to content writing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started working at Themeisle, I barely knew anything about WordPress. My only links to it were a personal blog on WordPress.com that I had created in college and writing for a few press websites in Romania that were built on WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was all I knew about WordPress, which was not zero (I just knew how to write a post and publish it) but still far from what I should have known for the job. I was willing to learn, though, and here I am nine years later. Actually, I would say that I got here, in the WordPress community, rather accidentally than intentionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a degree in Journalism and Communication Studies, my initial plans were revolving around being a sports reporter or press journalist. Funny enough, I ended up doing a different kind of press… WordPress. Haha!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before getting into the WordPress world, I was an aspiring journalist for a short time. Or a wanna-be journalist, if you will. I was adding brick by brick to the career in journalism that I had envisioned for myself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of these bricks was an <a href=\"https://www.sportrevolution.ro/catalina-ponor-mi-am-dorit-sa-fiu-printre-putinele-gimnaste-din-tara-care-au-mers-la-doua-olimpiade/\">interview with Cătălina Ponor</a> &#8211; a three-time Olympic champion in artistic gymnastics and one of the best Romanian gymnasts. She used to be one of my sports idols growing up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another brick to the journalism career was a feature article about how corruption in Romania was slowly killing performance in sports. This article, initially published on a website called Semnal Plus, received a lot of engagement and appreciation from Romanian sports fans. It eventually <a href=\"https://treizecizero.ro/burse/2015/12/08/sportul-comoara-nationala-care-ne-scapa-printre-degete/\">ended up on a popular tennis publication</a> in Romania &#8211; Treizecizero &#8211; as part of a writing contest, which brought me an internship with their editorial team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did write more similar content during college about sports for a popular sports newspaper in Romania and about rock/metal music for a niche news website. I remember being particularly proud of a bunch of them. They gave me the confidence that I had it in me for this career.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the future had different plans for me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after, I began to realize that being a reporter or press writer would bring too much stress, lack of free time, and little money. Let alone giving away a little bit of your dignity every day. At least, this is how I would describe most of the journalism work in Romania.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, these factors played a big role in thinking that maybe, just maybe, I could explore some other options to see if there was something there for me that wasn’t a direct affront to these values that were paramount to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-working-at-themeisle\">Working at Themeisle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not exaggerating for the sake of the story when I tell you that I got lucky finding Themeisle’s job announcement on a Facebook group. They were looking for a WordPress content writer. I didn’t even know what that meant, really. I just knew that yes, I did publish some articles on WordPress, so what could go wrong? I mean, I’ve used the platform before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it turned out to be different from what I expected because the job didn’t imply writing on WordPress but writing <em>about</em> WordPress. Which got me confused. So I had to learn the inside-outs of WordPress <em>while</em> I was trying to do my job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more, the job implied writing in English, which I had never done before. All my writing up until that point used to be in Romanian. This was also a struggle, to completely switch the language and make it sound okay and readable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was not easy to start from almost zero experience and knowledge. And not once did I feel like an impostor seeing other people excelling at their jobs. I used to be so hard on myself, beating myself up for every little mistake and feedback that was not meeting my expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a way, that’s a good thing because this is how you evolve. But now, as I’m getting wiser, I understand that this was a sign of perfectionism, which I will never achieve and I don’t even want to anymore. Simply because it doesn’t exist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I was saying, I started my journey at Vertigo Studio (the company behind <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/\">Themeisle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.codeinwp.com/\">CodeinWP</a>) at the age of 22. At that time, the company had around six or seven employees. This picture was taken a few years after when new people got on board:</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5958\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>My role was that of a content writer. But I&#8217;m a person who loves to experiment and try new things, so I have juggled many roles over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I went through social media, recruiting interns, mentoring, copywriting, outreach, email marketing, interviews, and partnerships with WordPress companies. The variety of activities kept me engaged, curious, and motivated. It’s always exciting and challenging when you do something for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my favorite would still be writing. My first love.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I was mainly writing content for the Themeisle and CodeinWP blogs, I had the opportunity to collaborate with other WordPress blogs, too. So I contributed a few pieces of content to websites like <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/adelina-tuca/\">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href=\"https://torquemag.io/2018/04/is-that-plugin-reliable-how-to-test-wordpress-plugins/\">TorqueMag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wpexplorer.com/wordpress-block-patterns/\">WPExplorer</a>, <a href=\"https://oceanwp.org/blog/are-ad-blockers-affecting-your-income-heres-how-to-prevent-them-from-harming-your-wordpress-business/\">OceanWP</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.wpzoom.com/blog/how-to-start-travel-blog-wordpress/\">WPZoom</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if I&#8217;m doing it in different forms, it all comes down to writing in the end. Interviews, for example, do count as writing plus a little bit of spice to the mix, which is connecting and meeting inspiring people in the community. It&#8217;s always interesting to meet people &#8211; even virtually &#8211; and hear their perspectives. You learn and become more open to different ideas and standpoints.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also interesting how a socially anxious person like me finds meaning in connecting with other people. It&#8217;s like a paradox, healing my social anxiety through socializing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://themeisle.com/blog/category/wordpress-community/interviews/\">Here</a>’s the full collection of interviews that I did on the Themeisle blog with the cool people we have in our WordPress ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Themeisle, I grew not only as a professional but also as a person. As a bonus, I had the chance to meet the amazing people that are my colleagues. In our company, we always motivate each other to grow and improve. So I had the opportunity to build meaningful bonds and valuable friendships that I hope will last a long, long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-contributing-to-wordcamps\">Contributing to WordCamps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team, we always strove to engage more with the WordPress community. This means getting involved in the local and international community. I, personally, enjoy WordCamps more when I play a bigger part than just attending.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost every year I either volunteered or enrolled in the media partners program which, yet again, meant meeting and interviewing people in person. The latter made me feel that journalist vibe again, bringing back old memories and emotions. It was about conversing with someone live, in real time, and getting into that nice sense of belonging. I wrote about this unique experience from WordCamp Europe <a href=\"https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-wceu-media-partners/\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still remember my first WordCamp Europe in Vienna, which I will never forget. I was all over the place, trying to do many things at once. I remember that I barely slept back then, trying to be on my volunteer duty early in the morning and also not miss any parties that would take place at night. That one was an event when I kind of forgot about my social anxiety and simply went with the flow, socializing and making friends. At that time I was a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/967051319923150849\">volunteer in the Communication Team</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1024x673.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5959\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, yes, signing up for extra work does put some pressure on your shoulders. But it’s worth it. You feel more fulfilled and useful to the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My message is, if you’re up for something, try to step out of your comfort zone a little bit. Know your comfort zone and step out a little bit every time. You’ll enjoy the experience more and most of the time you’ll be surprised by the outcome. This is how you grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-next\">What’s next</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I don’t know what the future has in store for me. I might find myself doing a totally different thing years from now or, who knows, still being part of the WordPress community. But no matter what’s next for me, I wouldn’t change a thing about the past and these awesome experiences that I shared together with amazing, inspiring people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think people are the fuel of everything that’s great in this world. And I want to believe that I’m one of these people who always strive to bring their best into the world and do good. At least, I’m trying.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id5952_c190c2-15 alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column5952_1ad0f6-31\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<h2 id=\"work-environment\" class=\"kt-adv-heading5952_886b34-83 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Adelina&#8217;s Work Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Adelina for a view into her development life and this is what she sent! </p>\n\n\n	<div class=\"hotspots-image-container\">\n		<img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/office-workspace-twin-peaks.jpg\" alt=\"Adelina Tuca\" class=\"hotspots-image skip-lazy\" />\n	</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading5952_976380-bf wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\">HeroPress would like to thank <a href=\"https://wpdrawattention.com/\">Draw Attention</a> for their donation of the plugin to make this interactive image!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"romanian\" class=\"kt-adv-heading5952_361701-44 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Rotițele care fac lumea să se miște</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>E o frumoasă coincidență că, în timp ce scriu acest articol, sunt foarte aproape de a celebra nouă ani de când lucrez la Themeisle. Mai lipsesc câteva săptămâni până la aniversare. Cred că este mare lucru să ai o continuitate și consistență în ceva, oricare ar fi acel ceva.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Această aniversare mai înseamnă și nouă ani de când fac parte din comunitatea WordPress. Dar să începem cu începutul.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-de-la-jurnalism-la-content-writing\">De la jurnalism la content writing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Când am început să lucrez la Themeisle, abia dacă știam ceva despre WordPress. Toate cunoștințele mele legate de asta se rezumau la un blog personal avut în facultate și câteva articole scrise pe niște site-uri de presă din România care foloseau platforma WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cam asta știam despre WordPress. Nu înseamnă neapărat că nu știam nimic, dar eram totuși departe de ce ar fi trebuit să știu pentru job. Totuși, eram o persoană dornică să învețe, așa că iată-mă tot aici nouă ani mai târziu. De fapt, aș putea spune că am nimerit în comunitatea WordPress mai mult dintr-un accident decât intenționat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Având studii în Jurnalism și Științele Comunicării, planul meu inițial era să ajung reporter sportiv sau jurnalist de presă sportivă. Ca să fac un joc de cuvinte care are sens mai mult în engleză, am sfârșit prin a face tot un fel de press, doar că WordPress. Sună mai bine în engleză partea asta. Haha!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dar înainte să pătrund în lumea WordPress, am făcut jurnalism pentru puțin timp. Eram o jurnalistă în devenire, dacă pot să spun așa. Cert e că începusem să construiesc în această direcție, punând cărămidă cu cărămidă.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Una dintre aceste cărămizi a fost <a href=\"https://www.sportrevolution.ro/catalina-ponor-mi-am-dorit-sa-fiu-printre-putinele-gimnaste-din-tara-care-au-mers-la-doua-olimpiade/\">interviul pe care l-am făcut cu Cătălina Ponor</a> &#8211; triplă campioană olimpică la gimnastică artistică și una dintre cele mai bune gimnaste din istoria României. Ea a fost unul dintre idolii mei din sport când eram copil și chiar adolescentă.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O altă cărămidă pe care o puneam la cariera în jurnalism a fost un articol de tip feature despre cum corupția din România ucide performanța sportivă încetul cu încetul. Inițial, articolul fusese publicat pe un website numit Semnal Plus, unde a primit multe reacții și apreciere din partea consumatorilor de sport din România. Acum mai apare online într-o populară publicație despre tenis &#8211; <a href=\"https://treizecizero.ro/burse/2015/12/08/sportul-comoara-nationala-care-ne-scapa-printre-degete/\">Treizecizero</a> &#8211; ca urmare a unui concurs la care am participat cu acest articol și pentru care am primit un internship la ei în redacție.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tot cam în aceeași perioadă am mai scris conținut similar despre sport pentru o publicație sportivă cunoscută în țară și despre muzica rock/metal pentru un site de știri de nișă. Îmi amintesc că am fost mândră de multe dintre ele. Toate acestea la un loc îmi dăduseră încredere că aveam ce îmi trebuie ca să continui pe drumul ăsta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dar viitorul avea alte planuri pentru mine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La puțin timp după, începeam să realizez că a fi reporter sau jurnalist de presă venea la pachet cu mult prea mult stres, puțin timp liber și puțini bani în comparație cu efortul depus. Lăsând la o parte faptul că trebuia să îți calci pe demnitate puțin câte puțin, până când aveai să ți-o pierzi pe toată. Cel puțin, așa aș descrie eu jurnalismul din România din acest moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pentru mine, acești factori au jucat un rol foarte important când am început să mă gândesc că poate aș putea să mă reorientez către ceva mai apropiat de valorile mele morale. Valori pe care nu îmi permiteam să mi le încalc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-munca-la-themeisle\">Munca la Themeisle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nu de dragul poveștii spun că am dat ca printr-un noroc de anunțul celor de la Themeisle pe un grup de Facebook. Căutau un content writer care să scrie despre WordPress. Nici măcar nu știam ce însemna asta. Știam doar că mai folosisem WordPress în trecut, deci ce putea să fie așa de greu?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ei bine, s-a dovedit a fi diferit față de ce mă așteptam eu pentru că jobul nu presupunea a scrie pe platforma WordPress, ci a scrie <em>despre</em> platforma WordPress. Lucru care m-a bulversat puțin. Așa că am fost nevoită să învăț WordPress de la zero.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mai mult decât atât, jobul presupunea să scriu în limba engleză, ceea ce nu mai făcusem înainte. Tot ce scrisesem până atunci fusese în română. Asta iarăși a îngreunat puțin lucrurile pentru că trebuia să schimb complet limba și s-o fac într-un mod în care să sune bine, inteligibil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nu a fost ușor să o iau aproape de la zero cu experiența și cunoștințele. Și nu de puține ori m-am simțit ca un impostor văzând cum alte persoane erau atât de bune în domeniul lor. Eram foarte dură cu mine, criticându-mă pentru orice greșeală sau feedback care nu îmi îndeplinea așteptările.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Într-un fel, asta poate fi un lucru bun pentru că te ajută să evoluezi. Dar acum, cu cât devin mai înțeleaptă, înțeleg că era perfecționismul din mine care nu-mi dădea pace. Un perfecționism pe care nu-l voi atinge niciodată pentru că el nu există. Acum sunt mai tolerantă cu mine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mi-am început călătoria la Vertigo Studio (compania din spatele <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/\">Themeisle</a> și <a href=\"https://www.codeinwp.com/\">CodeinWP</a>) la vârsta de 22 de ani. La acea vreme, compania avea în jur de șase sau șapte angajați. Poza următoare a fost făcută câțiva ani mai târziu, când deja firma angajase colegi noi:</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5958\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolul meu era acela de content writer. Dar, fiind o persoană căreia îi place să experimenteze și să încerce lucruri noi, am explorat mai multe roluri de-a lungul anilor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Am făcut social media, recrutare de interni, mentorat, copywriting, outreach, email marketing, interviuri și parteneriate cu companii din comunitatea WordPress. Această varietate de activități m-a ținut în priză, curioasă și motivată. E mereu mișto când faci ceva pentru prima oară.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dar principala și prima dragoste a rămas și va rămâne scrisul.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiar dacă am scris exclusiv pe blogurile Themeisle și CodeinWP în toți acești ani, am avut ocazia de a mai colabora și cu alte bloguri din WordPress. Am contribuit cu câteva articole pe site-uri precum <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/adelina-tuca/\">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href=\"https://torquemag.io/2018/04/is-that-plugin-reliable-how-to-test-wordpress-plugins/\">TorqueMag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wpexplorer.com/wordpress-block-patterns/\">WPExplorer</a>, <a href=\"https://oceanwp.org/blog/are-ad-blockers-affecting-your-income-heres-how-to-prevent-them-from-harming-your-wordpress-business/\">OceanWP</a>, sau <a href=\"https://www.wpzoom.com/blog/how-to-start-travel-blog-wordpress/\">WPZoom</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiar dacă ia diverse forme, la sfârșitul zilei totul se rezumă la scris. Interviurile, de exemplu, îmbină scrisul cu conectarea. E mereu interesant să întâlnești persoane noi &#8211; chiar și virtual &#8211; și să vezi ce perspective au ele. Înveți din chestia asta și devii mai deschis la noi puncte de vedere și idei.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totodată, mai e interesant cum o persoană anxioasă ca mine găsește confort în conexiunea cu alți oameni. E ca un paradox în care îți vindeci anxietatea socială prin socializare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://themeisle.com/blog/category/wordpress-community/interviews/\">Aici</a> găsiți întreaga colecție de interviuri pe care le-am făcut pe blogul Themeisle cu oameni mișto din comunitatea noastră de WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La Themeisle, nu doar am crescut ca om și ca profesionist. Pe deasupra, am avut șansa să cunosc și să lucrez cu niște oameni minunați cum sunt colegii mei. În compania noastră, ne motivăm unii pe alții să ne îmbunătățim și să evoluăm. Am avut oportunitatea să construiesc legături semnificative și prietenii valoroase care sper că vor rămâne neschimbate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-contribuția-la-wordcamps\">Contribuția la WordCamps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>La nivel de echipă, ne-am dorit mereu să ne implicăm în comunitate și să contribuim cât putem de mult. Atât pe piața locală, cât și internațională. Personal, eu mă bucur mai mult de experiența unui WordCamp când fac ceva în plus decât să particip.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aproape în fiecare an în care am participat, am ales fie să fiu voluntar, fie să mă implic în echipa de Media Partners, să simt că fac ceva.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prin programul de Media Partners am intervievat oameni din WordPress, de data asta live, în persoană. Ceea ce m-a făcut să simt din nou vibe-ul jurnalistic, aducând cu sine un soi de nostalgie. Acolo aveai o conversație cu cineva fizic, în timp real, ceea ce îți aducea un sentiment de apartenență. Am scris despre experiența de a fi partener media la WordCamp Europe <a href=\"https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-wceu-media-partners/\">aici</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Încă îmi amintesc primul meu WordCamp Europe din Viena, pe care nu o să-l uit niciodată. Eram peste tot atunci, încercând să fac cât mai multe lucruri deodată. Îmi amintesc că abia dacă dormeam, încercând să îmi fac și datoria de voluntar dis de dimineață, dar și să particip la petrecerile care aveau loc seara. Acela a fost un eveniment care m-a făcut să uit de anxietatea mea socială, în care pur și simplu am profitat la maximum de toate ocaziile de a socializa și cunoaște oameni mișto. Atunci am făcut parte din echipa de Comunicare, ca <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/967051319923150849\">voluntar</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image2-1024x673.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5959\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>Este adevărat că, atunci când te înscrii la muncă extra, vine la pachet cu presiune și cu emoții mai grele. Dar merită. Te face să te simți mai împlinit, mai util celor din jur.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mesajul meu pentru voi este să ieșiți din zona de confort măcar puțin atunci când vă implicați în ceva. Cunoașteți-vă zona de confort și ieșiți din ea câte puțin de fiecare dată. Vă veți bucura mai mult de experiență și, de cele mai multe ori, veți fi surprinși de rezultate. Așa reușim să creștem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ce-urmeaza\">Ce urmează</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincer, nu știu ce îmi pregătește viitorul, dacă o să mai fiu în comunitatea WordPress peste ani sau dacă o să fac cu totul altceva, în alt domeniu. Cine știe? Dar oricare ar fi viitorul, nu aș schimba nimic din ce s-a întâmplat până acum, din trecut. Nu aș schimba aceste experiențe pe care le-am împărțit cu oameni minunați.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cred că oamenii sunt catalizatorul a ceea ce este mai bun în lume. Și vreau să cred că și eu sunt unul dintre acești oameni care caută mereu să fie cea mai bună versiune a lor și să facă bine pe oriunde merg. Cel puțin, încerc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-fuel-of-everything-thats-great-in-the-world/\">The Fuel Of Everything That’s Great In The World &#8211; Rotițele care fac lumea să se miște</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 08:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Adelina Tuca\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.4 RC1 Released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=150315\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-rc1-released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2332:\"<p>WordPress 6.4 is one step closer to prime time with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/10/wordpress-6-4-release-candidate-1/\">RC1 available today</a>.

There are <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&changetime=10%2F12%2F2023..10%2F17%2F2023&milestone=6.4&col=id&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=id\">40 additional closed Trac tickets</a> since 6.4 Beta 4, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/commits/wp/6.4\">dozens of GitHub commits</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentyfour/commits/\">commits for Twenty Twenty-Four</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the flagship font library feature had to be <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-font-library-feature-punted-to-6-5-release\">punted to 6.5</a> due to gaps in the Font APIs that couldn&#8217;t be resolved in time, the upcoming release is still packed with new features and improvements. A few highlights include a new lightbox functionality, redesigned command palette, block hooks, expanded design tools, and a new default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release candidate phase marks the hard string freeze where no new strings can be added so that the Polyglots team can ensure WordPress 6.4 gets translated. At this point, only regressions introduced during this development cycle and expansions to the test suite can be addressed in the 6.4 milestone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme and plugin developers are encouraged to test their extensions against the release candidate. Plugin authors are also advised to update the<em>“Tested up to”</em> version in their readme files to 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second RC is expected next week.

Playground is an experimental project that uses WebAssembly (WASM) to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-prototype-runs-wordpress-in-the-browser-with-no-php-server\">run WordPress in the browser</a>. It creates a WordPress instance with admin access without having to install PHP, MySQL, or Apache, making it nearly instantaneous to fire up a test site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing pull requests is one of the most exciting use cases for the Playground project. The newly launched WordPress Core PR previewer can be found at <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/wordpress.html\">playground.wordpress.net/wordpress.html</a>. Users can enter the PR number or the URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2332\" height=\"1298\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-17-at-4.10.46-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150303\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/pull/700\">PR for for previewing wordpress-develop repository pull pequests</a> adds support for a few query parameters that developers can use to customize how the preview loads:<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/205419/274972437-e30e9ac6-c99e-4e81-b68f-45e14116f6c9.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>?pr=5481</code>&nbsp;– preview that PR</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>?url=/wp-admin/post-new.php</code>&nbsp;– load that URL in WordPress</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>?mode=seamless</code>&nbsp;– redirect to a full-screen Playground without the browser chrome and any other extra UI elements</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Zieliński identified a couple of known issues with this first implementation that developers should be aware of when working with the previewer: Existing PRs need a rebase to work but new PRs work just fine. Additionally, if you test it out, you will find that downloading WordPress may take a long time, as the bundle is ~45MB. Contributors are working on finding a way to optimize this so that it&#8217;s quicker and more efficient to preview PRs. Any problems or bugs can be reported to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues\">Playground repository&#8217;s issues</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/696\">Playground roadmap</a>, Zieliński is working on making <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/696\">a pull request previewer for all WordPress projects</a>, not just core, as he outlined in a planning issue:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Previewing WordPress Pull Requests requires either a local development setup or a staging setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developers often use either a staging environment that can only run a single branch at a time, or no staging environment at all. This makes testing and team workflows difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing an easy way to preview pull requests using Playground would alleviate that burden, catalyze more reviews across the ecosystem, and make calls for testing easier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress meta contributors recently implemented a “Live Preview” button for plugins in the official directory but ended up <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-reverts-live-preview-button-on-plugins-after-developer-backlash\">reverting it after many plugins were broken</a> due to inadequate support in the Playground environment.
